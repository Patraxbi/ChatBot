i circular economy 
1 definition 

fig 1 concept of circular economy m geissdoerfer et al 2020 circular busines model a review journal of clean production article 123741 

the european parliament define circular economy ce a a model of production and consumption that involf share lease reuse repair refurbish and recycle exist material and product a long a possible in thi way the life cycle of product be extend 
in practice it imply reduce waste to a minimum when a product reach the end of it life it material be keep within the economy wherever possible thank to recycle these can be productively use again and again thereby create far value 
by comparison in a linear economy natural resource be turn into product that be ultimately destine to become waste because of the way they have be design and manufacture thi proces be often summarize a take make waste by contrast a circular economy aim to transition from a takemakewaste approach to a more restorative and regenerative system it employ reuse share repair refurbishment remanufacturing and recycle mean consumerismaltering concept and action to create a closedloop system reduce the use of resource input and the creation of waste pollution and carbon emission the circular economy aim to keep product material equipment and infrastructure in use for long thu improve the productivity of these resource waste material and energy should become input for other process through waste valorization either a a component for another industrial proces or a regenerative resource for nature eg compost the ellen macarthur foundation emf define the circular economy a an industrial economy that be restorative or regenerative by value and design 
a comprehensive definition could be circular economy be an economic system that target zero waste and pollution throughout material lifecycle from environment extraction to industrial transformation and final consumer apply to all involve ecosystem upon it lifetime end material return to either an industrial proces or in the case of a treat organic residual safely back to the environment a in a natural regenerate cycle it operate by create value at the macro meso and micro level and exploit to the full the sustainability nest concept use energy source be clean and renewable resource use and consumption be efficient government agency and responsible consumer play an active role in ensure the correct system longterm operation g c nobre et al 20210910 the quest for a circular economy final definition a scientific perspective journal of clean production 314 127973 

fig 2 difference between the circular economy and the linear economy catherine weetmanown work cc bysa 40 link 2016 
may be the most clearly explain a circular economy reduce material use redesign material product and service to be le resource intensive and recapture waste a a resource to manufacture new material product and energy 
2 circular economy and sustainability 
the 2030 agenda for sustainable development wa adopt by all unite nation member state in 2015 provide a share blueprint for peace and prosperity for person and the planet now and into the future at it heart be the 17 sustainable development goal sdg which be an urgent call for action by all country develop and develop in a global partnership they recognize that end poverty and other deprivation must go handinhand with strategy that improve health and education reduce inequality and spur economic growth all while tackle climate change and work to preserve my ocean and forest 
the circular economy ha the potential to contribute significantly to the sustainable development goal sdg set by the unite nation un the ellen macarthur foundation state that the circular economy offer a powerful vision for a future in which economic growth be decouple from resource constraint and negative environmental impact ellen macarthur foundation nd 
one of the critical way the circular economy can contribute to the sdg be by reduce waste and pollution accord to the european environment agency the circular economy aim to minimize the environmental impact of economic activity by close the loop on resource use it seek to keep product component and material at their high utility and value at all time thereby eliminate the generation of waste and minimize the use of natural resource european environment agency 2018 by reuse and recycle resource the circular economy help reduce the amount of waste generate and the amount of pollution release into the environment ghisellini et al 2017 thi can positively impact the goal of ensure sustainable city and community and the pursuit of responsible consumption and production sdg 11 and 12 
among the successful initiative attempt to reduce waste and pollution through the circular economy be the city of malm malm miljbyrn program launch in 2002 thi program aim to reduce the city environmental impact by implement variou measure include recycle compost and reuse city of malm nd a part of thi program the city ha establish a network of recycle station compost facility and a range of educational and outreach program to promote the circular economy in addition the city ha implement a range of circular procurement policy include use life cycle assessment tool to evaluate the environmental impact of product and service city of malm nd 
beside reduce waste and pollution the circular economy can promote economic growth and development accord to the world busines council for sustainable development the circular economy can drive innovation create new busines opportunity and job and contribute to the competitivenes of company and region it can also enhance resource productivity reduce cost and improve resilience world busines council for sustainable development 2015 by create new busines opportunity and job the circular economy can contribute to the goal of decent work and economic growth sdg 8 it can also promote innovation and technological development support industry plan innovation and infrastructure sdg 9 for example the circular economy can support the development of small and medium enterprise which can help to build more inclusive and diverse economic system ghisellini et al 2017 
a successful example of a circular economy economic benefit be the circular textile industry in the netherland accord to the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management the circular textile industry in the netherland be a fastgrowing sector which generate a turnover of more than 1 billion per year and employ around 15000 person ministry of infrastructure and water management nd thi industry ha develop a range of innovative busines model include circular design production and consumption which have help create new economic opportunity and job and reduce waste and pollution ministry of infrastructure and water management nd 
in addition to promote economic growth and development and resource efficiency the circular economy can also support the goal of sustainable city and community sdg 11 the city of san francisco zero waste program launch in 2002 aim to divert all of the city solid waste from landfill and incineration by 2020 through the implementation of a range of measure include recycle compost and reuse city and county of san francisco nd a of 2019 the city have achieve an 82 waste diversion rate up from just 52 in 2002 result in significant reduction in waste and pollution city and county of san francisco 2019 the succes of the zero waste program demonstrate the significant role that local government can play in promote the circular economy and support the achievement of the sdg 
the circular economy can also contribute to resource efficiency and the use of renewable resource accord to the unite nation environment program a circular economy can increase resource productivity and decrease the demand for virgin resource a well a low greenhouse ga emission and improve energy security thi can also help reduce economy vulnerability to resource price fluctuation and supply risk unite nation environment program 2017 by use resource more efficiently the circular economy can help reduce the demand for nonrenewable resource and promote renewable resource ghisellini et al 2017 thi can support the goal of ensure acces to affordable reliable and modern energy for all sdg 7 and the goal of climate action sdg 13 
in term of resource efficiency one example of the circular economy benefit be the cradle to cradle design approach develop by the german company mbdc thi approach be base on circular economy principle and aim to design product that can be continually reuse and recycle rather than dispose of at the end of their life mbdc nd accord to mbdc the cradletocradle design approach ha successfully reduce nonrenewable resource and promote renewable resource while reduce waste and pollution 
moreover it be imperative to consider the potential impact of the circular economy on equity and inclusion while the circular economy ha the potential to bring significant benefit include economic growth and development it be crucial to ensure that these benefit be share equitably ghisellini et al 2017 a the unite nation development program note achieve the sdg require the active participation and empowerment of all stakeholder include marginalize and disadvantage group to ensure that no one be leave behind thi may require target effort to support the participation of marginalize and disadvantage group in the circular economy such a through train and capacitybuilding program additionally marginalize and disadvantage group must not be negatively impact by the transition to a circular economy 
among the circular economy initiative that emphasize equity and inclusion be the circular economy for all initiative launch by the european commission in 2019 thi initiative aim to ensure that the benefit of the circular economy be share equitably and to support the participation of marginalize and disadvantage group in the circular economy european commission 2019 a part of thi initiative the european commission ha develop a range of measure to promote the inclusion of marginalize and disadvantage group in the circular economy include the development of train and capacitybuilding program the establishment of a circular economy stakeholder platform to promote dialogue and cooperation between different stakeholder and the development of a circular economy finance support platform to support the finance of circular project 
the role of local government in promote the circular economy be crucial accord to the european committee of the region local and regional government play a key role in drive the transition toward a circular economy a they be responsible for implement the majority of environmental and waste policy a well a invest in infrastructure and provide public service european committee of the region 2018 local government can take many step to promote the circular economy thi include implement circular procurement policy support the development of circular busines model and invest in infrastructure for waste collection and treatment 
an example of the role local government play in promote circular economy be the city of gothenburg circular gothenburg initiative launch in 2017 thi initiative aim to transform gothenburg into a circular city by 2030 by implement variou measure include recycle compost and reuse city of gothenburg nd a part of thi initiative the city ha establish a range of circular procurement policy include use life cycle assessment tool to evaluate the environmental impact of product and service city of gothenburg nd in addition the city ha establish a circular economy innovation hub which support business and organization develop circular solution 
another example of the role of local government in promote the circular economy be the city of aarhus aarhu the sustainable city initiative which aim to make aarhu a fully sustainable city by 2030 city of aarhu nd a part of thi initiative the city ha implement a number of measure to promote the circular economy include the development of circular procurement guideline for public authority the establishment of a circular economy innovation hub and the implementation of a repair cafe program which provide support for the repair of break or damage item city of aarhu nd the succes of these initiative demonstrate the potential for local government to play a lead role in the transition to a circular economy 
denmark be a leader in the transition to a circular economy with a range of initiative at the national and local level to promote the circular economy and support the achievement of the sdg the danish ministry of the environment circular denmark initiative launch in 2016 aim to transform denmark into a fully circular economy by 2050 danish ministry of the environment nd a part of thi initiative the ministry ha develop a range of measure to promote the circular economy include the establishment of a circular economy secretariat to support the implementation of circular economy policy the development of circular procurement guideline for public authority and the implementation of a circular public sector program which aim to stimulate the demand for circular product and service in the public sector danish ministry of the environment nd 

fig 3 the circular economy model source european parliament research service 

many tool and resource be available to help local government implement circular economy strategy the european union resource efficiency support center provide support and guidance to local and regional authority in develop and implement circular economy strategy european commission nd the ellen macarthur foundation circularity index be a tool that measure the circularity of economy at the regional and national level and provide recommendation for improve circularity ellen macarthur foundation nd in addition the world busines council for sustainable development circularity index for city be a tool that help city ass their circularity and identify opportunity for improvement world busines council for sustainable development nd 
it be to underline the need of assess the ethical implication of resource use and waste and examine the value and principle that should guide the transition to a circular economy thi could include the principle of climate justice which recognize the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalize and disadvantage community and call for a just and equitable transition to a lowcarbon economy unite nation framework convention on climate change 2018 
3 benefit of switch to a circular economy 
to protect the environment 
reuse and recycle product would slow down the use of natural resource reduce landscape and habitat disruption and help to limit biodiversity los 
another benefit from the circular economy be a reduction in total annual greenhouse ga emission accord to the european environment agency industrial process and product use be responsible for 910 of greenhouse ga emission in the eu while the management of waste account for 332 
create more efficient and sustainable product from the start would help to reduce energy and resource consumption a it be estimate that more than 80 of a product environmental impact be determine during the design phase 
a shift to more reliable product that can be reuse upgrade and repair would reduce the amount of waste package be a grow issue and on average the average european generate nearly 180 kilo of package waste per year the aim be to tackle excessive package and improve it design to promote reuse and recycle 
reduce raw material dependence 
the world population be grow and with it the demand for raw material however the supply of crucial raw material be limit 
finite supply also mean some eu country be dependent on other country for their raw material accord to eurostat the eu import about half of the raw material it consume 
the total value of trade import plu export of raw material between the eu and the rest of the world ha almost triple since 2002 with export grow fast than import regardles the eu still import more than it export in 2021 thi result in a trade deficit of 355 billion 
recycle raw material mitigate the risk associate with supply such a price volatility availability and import dependency 
thi especially apply to critical raw material need for the production of technology that be crucial for achieve climate goal such a battery and electric engine 
create job and save consumer money 
move toward a more circular economy could increase competitivenes stimulate innovation boost economic growth and create job 700000 job in the eu alone by 2030 
redesign material and product for circular use would also boost innovation acros different sector of the economy 
consumer will be provide with more durable and innovative product that will increase the quality of life and save them money in the long term 
4 circular economy action plan of the european green deal 2020 
a context 
yet by 2050 the world will be consume a if there be three planet earth global consumption of material such a biomas fossil fuel metal and mineral be expect to double in the next forty year while annual waste generation be project to increase by 70 by 2050 
so it be more than necessary a regenerative growth model that gife back to the planet more than it take advance toward keep it resource consumption within planetary boundary and therefore strive to reduce it consumption footprint and double it circular material use rate in the come decade 
circular economy action plan be a product policy framework that will make sustainable product service and busines model the norm and transform consumption pattern so that no waste be produce in the first place thi sustainable product policy framework ha a central objective to reduce waste and ensure that the eu ha a wellfunctioning internal market for high quality secondary raw material the capacity of the eu to take responsibility for it waste will be also strengthen 

b main need action 
i design sustainable product 
in order to make product fit for a climateneutral resourceefficient and circular economy reduce waste and ensure that the performance of frontrunner in sustainability progressively become the norm the commission will propose a sustainable product policy legislative initiative 
the core of thi legislative initiative will be to widen the eco design directive beyond energyrelated product so a to make the eco design framework applicable to the broad possible range of product and make it deliver on circularity 
a part of thi legislative initiative and where appropriate through complementary legislative proposal the commission will consider establish sustainability principle and other appropriate way to regulate the follow aspect 
improve product durability reusability upgradability and reparability 
address the presence of hazardou chemical in product and increase their energy and resource efficiency 
increase recycle content in product while ensure their performance and safety 
enable remanufacturing and highquality recycle 
reduce carbon and environmental footprint 
restrict singleuse and counter premature obsolescence 
introduce a ban on the destruction of unsold durable good 
incentivizing productasaservice or other model where producer keep the ownership of the product or the responsibility for it performance throughout it lifecycle 
mobilize the potential of digitalization of product information include solution such a digital passport tag and watermark 
reward product base on their different sustainability performance include by link high performance level to incentive 
priority will be give to address product group identify in the context of the value chain feature in thi action plan such a electronic ict and textile but also furniture and high impact intermediary product such a steel cement and chemical far product group will be identify base on their environmental impact and circularity potential 
the commission will also increase the effectivenes of the current eco design framework for energyrelated product 
the review of the eco design directive a well a far work on specific product group under the eco design framework or in the context of other instrument will build where appropriate on criterium and rule establish under the eu ecolabel regulation the product environmental footprint approach and the eu gpp criterium 
furthermore to support the effective and efficient application of the new sustainable product framework the commission will 
establish a common european dataspace for smart circular application with datum on value chain and product information 
ius empower consumer and public buyer 
the commission will propose a revision of eu consumer law to ensure that consumer receive trustworthy and relevant information on product at the point of sale include on their lifespan and on the availability of repair service spare part and repair manual 
iius circularity in production process 
the commission will enable great circularity in industry by 
assess option for far promote circularity in industrial process in the context of the review of the industrial emission directive include the integration of circular economy practice in upcoming best available technique 
facilitate industrial symbiosi by develop an industryled report and certification system and enable the implementation of industrial symbiosi 
support the sustainable and circular biobased sector through the implementation of the bioeconomy action plan 
promote the use of digital technology for track trace and map of resource 
promote the uptake of green technology through a system of solid verification by register the eu environmental technology verification scheme a an eu certification mark 

c key product value chain 
i electronic and ict 
ius battery and vehicle 
iius package 
reduce overpackaging and package waste include by set target and other waste prevention measure 
drive design for reuse and recyclability of package 
iv plastic 
the eu strategy for plastic in the circular economy with measure to reduce plastic litter source label and use of biobased plastic base on assess where the use of biobased feedstock result in genuine environmental benefit go beyond reduction in use fossil resource 
use of biodegradable or compostable plastic 
v textile boost the sort reuse and recycle of textile include through innovation 
vus construction and build 
it be propose the construction product regulation include the possible introduction of recycle content requirement for certain construction product take into account their safety and functionality 
vius food water and nutrient boost the sustainability of renewable biobased material include through action follow the bioeconomy strategy and action plan 
there be proposal for a new water reuse regulation and directive on wastewater treatment and sewage sludge 

d other topic 
1enhancing circularity in a toxicfree environment by develop methodology to minimize the presence of substance that pose problem to health or the environment in recycle material and article make thereof 
2 create a wellfunctioning eu market for secondary raw material 
3 the propose european urban initiative the intelligent city challenge initiative and the circular city and region initiative will provide key assistance to city circular economy will be among the priority area of the green city accord 
4 drive the transition through research innovation and digitalization

5 circular busines model bm 
busines model innovation be the conceptualization and implementation of new busines model that can comprise the development of entirely new busines model the diversification into additional busines model the acquisition of new busines model or the transformation from one busines model to another the transformation can affect the entire bm or individual or a combination of it value proposition value creation and deliver and value capture element the interrelation between the element and the value network m geissdoerfer et al 2020 circular busines model a review journal of clean production article 123741 



fig 5 circular busines model strategy m geissdoerfer et al 2020 circular busines model a review journal of clean production article 123741 
the fmy different type of circular busines model innovation identify 
1 circular busines model transformation describe the modification of an exist busines model while the initial busines model can be either both conventional or circular the result busines model incorporate circular economy strategy 
2 circular startup refer to the creation of new busines model that incorporate circular economy strategy ie cycle extend intensify andor dematerialize resource loop outside of an exist company with their own brand employee and resource although they can be support by nonindependent institution such a incubator or accelerator 
3 circular busines model diversification describe the development of new busines model that incorporate circular economy strategy from within an exist organization by use their resource and network the current busines model of the parent organization stay in place and the new busines model be either integrate into the organization a new business or spunoff a subsidiary thi also include joint busines model innovation project with other organization 
4 circular busines model acquisition describe merger and acquisition ma activity that target busines model that incorporate circular economy strategy it comprise the identification acquisition and integration of new circular busines model the extent of integration can vary 
organization can also combine different strategy for example support startup with an incubator program and acquire successful participate for their busines model portfolio while also diversify their portfolio with the output of an internal busines build unit they could also divest from their core busines toward thi new portfolio or leverage acquisition to introduce circular economy capability to transform their core busines model 




fig 6 fmy type of circular busines model innovation m geissdoerfer et al 2020 circular busines model a review journal of clean production article 123741 

of these strategy the transformation might have the high potential impact especially if it replace an exist linear model with a circular one 
strategic alliance could also be of interest because of the important role of ecosystem partnership alliance can be an enabler for the different strategy for example in the context of circular busines model transformation beverage company in denmark have team up with municipality to create a coordination entity to manage the return system for package recycle

fig 7 circular economy initiative in the european union p mhatre et al sustainable production and consumption 26 2021 187202 

main conclusion the analysi point to the fact that recycle be the most commonly use ce strategy additionally technical nutrient be loop more a compare to biological one most of the ce initiative have be implement at a macro level ie in city or region or nationwide the penetration of ce ha be vary in variou industry while wastemanagement electrical and electronic equipment and construction industry be rapidly adopt the ce principle industry like mine and quarry health equipment and entertainment and recreation have have a slow approach toward ce 

ius circular bioeconomy 

1 biobased economy bioeconomy 
the bioeconomy mean use renewable biological resource from land and sea like crop forest fish animal and microorganism to produce food material and energy eu commission definition strong development of the bioeconomy will help the eu accelerate progress toward a circular and lowcarbon economy it will help modernize and strengthen the eu industrial base create new value chain and green more costeffective industrial process while protect biodiversity and the environment 
biobased economy bioeconomy or biotechonomy be an economic activity involve the use of biotechnology and biomas in the production of good service or energy the term be widely use by regional development agency national and international organization and biotechnology company they be closely link to the evolution of the biotechnology industry and the capacity to study understand and manipulate genetic material that ha be possible due to scientific research and technological development thi include the application of scientific and technological development to agriculture health chemical and energy industry 
the term bioeconomy be and biobased economy bbe be sometime use interchangeably however it be worth to distinguish them the biobased economy take into consideration the production of nonfood good whilst bioeconomy cover both biobased economy and the production and use of food and fee 
accord to european union bioeconomy strategy update in 2018 the bioeconomy cover all sector and system that rely on biological resource animal plant microorganism and derive biomas include organic waste their function and principle it cover all primary production and economic and industrial sector that base on use production or process biological resource from agriculture forestry fishery and aquaculture the product of bioeconomy be typically food fee and other biobased product bioenergy and service base on biological resource the bioeconomy aim to drive toward sustainability circularity a well a the protection of the environment and will enhance biodiversity 
in some definition bioeconomy comprise also ecosystem service that be service offer by the environment include bind carbon dioxide and opportunity for recreation another key aspect of the bioeconomy be not waste natural resource but use and recycle them efficiently 
accord to eu bioeconomy report 2016 the bioeconomy bring together variou sector of the economy that produce proces and reuse renewable biological resource agriculture forestry fishery food biobased chemical and material and bioenergy 
one opportunity wa make economic use of the emerge new potential of use biotechnology a indicate above another opportunity inherent in the concept of the bioeconomy be the replacement of fossilbased resource by biobased resource both for energy and for material use in develop the concept of the bioeconomy in the eu the label knowledgebased wa add so that it become the knowledgebased bioeconomy the label knowledgebased wa in line with the eu innovation policy that prevail at the time 
the concept of the knowledgebased economy reflect the vision of achieve economic growth through hightechnology industry which require investment in innovation and highly skilled labor 
the development of the concept of the bioeconomy wa characterize by two perspective 1 the resource substitution perspective and 2 the biotechnology innovation perspective

type of application function of domain of interest 
environment 
the aim of environmental biotechnology be to develop sustainable environmental practice that reduce pollution and waste the follow be example of environmental biotech 
phytoremediation use genetically engineer microorganism to purify soil of heavy metal and other pollutant 
bioremediation introduce microorganism into waste site in order to organically break down nonrecyclable waste 
plasticeating bacterium break down waste such a plastic in soil and water 
gmo food stay fresh long and reduce food waste 
genetic restoration attempt to restore endanger specie 
covercrop such a corn be use a biofuel replace traditional fuel source that produce greenhouse ga emission when extract and use 
most genetic engineer be perform in laboratory 
medicine 
medical biotechnology also know a biopharma aim to fight and prevent disease and improve healthcare biotechnology and biomedical research be the basi of the modern pharmaceutical industry use include the follow 
stem cell research that help replace or repair dead or defective cell 
antibiotic development 
gene therapy for disease such a leukemium 
research into dangerou pathogen and the antibody that fight them 
3d print or grow of organ and bone in lab and 
mrna vaccine monoclonal antibody treatment and research for covid19 
industry 
industrial biotechnology involf use microorganism to produce industrial good example include the follow 
production of industrial enzyme 
industrial biotechnology process be be employ to create bio plastic 
fermentation and the use of enzyme and microbe to streamline chemical manufacture and reduce operational cost and chemical emission 
biofuel that use renewable crop such a corn to produce combustible fuel instead of natural nonrenewable fossil fuel resource such a petroleum and oil and 
biodegradable garment and textile make from the protein of live organism such a the silk protein of spider 
agriculture 
bio agricultural product can be divide into three major sector seed agro bio product instead of agro chemical and bio fertilizer 
agricultural biotechnology can produce genetically engineer plant and animal to realize a more efficient agriculture increase nutritional value and reduce food insecurity some example of agricultural biotechnology be the follow 
animal cell and plant cell cultivation technology 
modern food biotechnology base on genetically modify organism 
biologically produce pesticide and herbicide that be le harmful to human than chemical one 
droughtresistant crop 
minimal spaceresilient crop 
meat grow in lab or use 3d printer 
glutenfree grain friendly to sufferer of celiac 
selective breed that produce healthy big livestock and crop and 
nutrient supplementation that infuse food with add nutrient to improve diet and medical treatment 

2 circular bioeconomy 
biomas be project to play a key role in meet global climate target to achieve a resourceefficient biomas use european bioeconomy strategy increasingly consider the concept of a circular bioeconomy cbe 
the update bioeconomy strategy of the european commission 2018a announce that the european bioeconomy need to have sustainability and circularity at it heart many key strategy toward a more resourceefficient and circular bioeconomy eg integrate biorefinery and cascade use of biomas depend on a close cooperation of local actor from agriculture industry research and regional public institution eg within bioeconomy cluster 
the ellen macarthur foundation 2013 imply that the bioeconomy be an integral part of the ce by include the biological cycle into their ce illustration similarly temme and peck 2019 see the cbe a a ce where nonrenewable input to industrial system be replace by renewable biological resource the european commission 2017 define the cbe a the application of the ce concept to biological resource product and material 


fig 10 the circular bioeconomy cbe in relation with bioeconomy beand circular economy ce 

the circular bioeconomy focuse on the sustainable resourceefficient valorization of biomas in integrate multioutput production chain eg biorefinery while also make use of residue and waste and optimize the value of biomas over time vium cascade such an optimization can focu on economic environmental or social aspect and ideally consider all three pillar of sustainability the cascade step aim at retain the resource quality by adhere to the biobased value pyramid and the waste hierarchy where possible and adequate paul stegmann et al resource conservation and recycle x6 2020 100029 

fig 11 the circular bioeconomy and it element paul stegmann et al resource conservation and recycle x6 2020 100029 


fig 12 biobase value pyramid aul stegmann et al resource conservation and recycle x6 2020 100029 

in a cbe more biomas would ideally first be delegate to a material use before after one or potentially multiple cascade step it would be delegate to a final energetic use or compost in theory thi cascade would follow a movement down the biobased value pyramid and the waste hierarchy move from high value to low value biomas application move from the upper part of the biobased value pyramid and the waste hierarchy to the low part theoretically go along with decrease option for far use and cascade opportunity due to the lower of the resource quality stay on the upper part of both hierarchy would therefore theoretically be desirable in a cbe however in practice application on the low part might still be preferable from an environmental and economic perspective 
practitioner in bioeconomy cluster can support the development toward a cbe by 1 facilitate cooperation between stakeholder along and acros supply chain 2 foster biobased product design that facilitate durability reuse repair recycle or biodegradability 3 foster the use of residue and waste a resource 4 intensify the cooperation with the waste management sector to ensure that the biobased product can be integrate in collection separation recycle and compost scheme 
in the intersection area that define the cbe concept three complementary view can be find a key interface between cbe and ce first the utilization of biomas a a resource since thi include byproduct residue and waste use it keep material in the economy for long close material loop and increase resource productivity second the cascade use of biomas ie the sequential recycle of a material into another type of product after it use here the main target of both cascade use and ce be an increase resource efficiency and low demand for raw material with both be frequently link to value addition and job creation a brandao et al journal of clean production 295 2021 126407 the pulp and paper or textile industry be good example of how cascade ha be use for decade long before the term itself become mainstream third the strive to create a more sustainable and resource efficient society in thi regard both ce and cbe minimize the use of fossil fuel the ce concept strengthen the resource efficiency of process and the use of recycle material to reduce the demand for fossil carbon while cbe substitute fossil carbon by renewable carbon from biomas caru and dammer 2018 thu cbe emerge a the result of the pursuit of a more sustainable and resource efficient world provide variou societal economic and environmental benefit 
recycle and other circular waste management practice be a key part of the cbe paradigm a exemplify by the sustainable resourceefficient valorization of biomas in integrate production chain eg biorefinery while make use of residue and waste for instance the product sector relate to plastic and build material have significant recycle and cascade potential however establish waste management practice do not necessarily result in the most economical or environmentally friendly solution in fact key challenge for implement circular strategy include cost beside eg policy and regulation and the current small size of biobased market in thi context stegmann et al 2020 suggest the optimization of the value of biomas over time a a key characteristic of the cbe such an optimization can focu on economic eg for profit environmental eg for ghg emission andor social aspect eg for job 
the circular bioeconomy ha great potential to catalyze an inclusive european economic political and societal project that be urgently need 
the shift to a circular biobased economic paradigm should be a longterm strategy for decouple economic growth from environmental degradation 
recommendation for european circular bioeconomy development hetemaki l et al lead the way to a european circular bioeconomy strategy from science to policy 5 european forest institute 2017 
circular bioeconomy strategy should not take sustainability a a give but addres it explicitly 
a there can be synergy between economic growth and improvement in the state of natural capital the pace of growth be not the problem but rather the quality of growth it require the advancement of truly sustainable economic growth and not the type of unsustainable growth often see in the past one essential requirement be that renewable resource be not use to the extent that they can no long reproduce themself ie they become nonrenewable 
b natural capital be a necessary production input along with the traditional one 
c research development and innovation rdi need to increase to strengthen the foundation of a circular bioeconomy 
a circular bioeconomy can help to support biodiversity and climate mitigation biodiversity and climate mitigation be necessary for a successful circular bioeconomy

3 refine solid waste to product and energy 
the core specific technological operation characteristic to circular bioeconomy be waste use cascade principle of biomas use biorefining 
biorefining concept 
biorefining the sustainable process of biomas into a spectrum of marketable biobased product and bioenergybiofuel be an innovative and efficient approach to use available biomas resource for the synergistic coproduction of power heat and biofuel alongside food and fee ingredient pharmaceutical chemical material mineral and shortcyclic co2 a biorefinery be an overall concept of a process plant where biomas feedstock be convert and extract into a spectrum of valuable product httpsknowledge4policyeceuropaeuglossaryitembiorefineryen 
biorefining be one of the key enable strategy of the circular economy close loop of raw biomas material reuse of forestry agro proces and postconsumer residue mineral water and carbon therefore biorefining be the optimal strategy for largescale sustainable use of biomas in the bio economy it will result in costcompetitive coproduction of foodfeed ingredient biobased product and bioenergy combine with optimal socioeconomic and environmental impact efficient use of resource reduce ghg emission etc
