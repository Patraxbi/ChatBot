eu target the zeropollution vision for 2050 a healthy planet for all 
air water and soil pollution be reduce to level no long consider harmful to health and natural ecosystem and that respect the boundary my planet can cope with thu create a toxicfree environment the zeropollution ambition be a crosscut objective contribute to the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development and complement the 2050 climateneutrality goal in synergy with the clean and circular economy and restore biodiversity goal 
the zero pollution target for 2030 
under eu law green deal ambition and in synergy with other initiative by 2030 the eu should reduce 
1 by more than 55 the health impact premature death of air pollution 
2 by 30 the share of person chronically disturb by transport noise 
3 by 25 the eu ecosystem where air pollution threaten biodiversity 
4 by 50 nutrient loss the use and risk of chemical pesticide the use of the more hazardou one and the sale of antimicrobial for farm animal and in aquaculture 
5 by 50 plastic litter at sea and by 30 microplastic release into the environment 
6 significantly total waste generation and by 50 residual municipal waste 
the zero pollution for 2050 strategy impact variou european directive include 
industrial emission directive 
water framework directive and relate water directive drink water wastewater 
eu soil strategy 
farm to fork strategy 
air quality standard 
1 motivation and plan achievement from pathway to a healthy planet for all eu action plan toward zero pollution for air water and soil 12052021 
climate change environmental pollution1 biodiversity los and an unsustainable use of natural resource pose multiple risk to human animal and ecosystem health to build a healthy planet for all the european green deal3 call for the eu to good monitor report prevent and remedy air water soil and consumer product pollution among other thing 
directive 201075eu article 32 pollution mean the direct or indirect introduction a a result of human activity of substance vibration heat or noise into air water or land which may be harmful to human health or the quality of the environment result in damage to material property or impair or interfere with amenity and other legitimate use of the environment 
there be an urgency to act in the eu every year pollution cause 1 in 8 death the fight against pollution be also a fight for fairnes and equality pollution most harmful impact on human health be typically bear by the most vulnerable group 
pollution also threaten my biodiversity and significantly contribute to the ongoing ma extinction of specie together with change in land and sea use overexploitation of natural resource climate change and invasive alien specie pollution be one of the five main driver of biodiversity los 
economic progress and pollution reduction can go together between 2000 and 2017 the eu gdp grow by 32 while emission of the main air pollutant decrease by 10 ammonium mainly from agriculture to 70 sulfur oxide mainly from industrial production however the overall fivefold growth of the global economy in the past five decade ha come at massive cost to the global environment 
the economic case for act on pollution be clear and the benefit for society far outweigh the cost just a the cost of inaction hugely outweigh the cost of action 
at the same time we need a good integrate overview of pollution for public and private actor to tackle connect pollution issue acros space and time and addres their interplay with other environmental social and economic consideration a effectively a possible in their policy investment and purchase decision 
pollution do not stop at border while pollution enter the eu through ocean river wind or import good the eu also cause significant pollution elsewhere in the world through it own production and consumption pattern a well a it waste at the same time the eu ha powerful tool to contribute to pollution mitigation effort worldwide vium it policy and fund it green diplomacy a well a by stimulate innovation with clean production and more sustainable consumption of good and service 
the main objective of thi action plan be to provide a compas for include pollution prevention in all relevant eu policy 


fig 1 the zeropollution hierarchy reverse the pyramid of action prioritize the approach for tackle pollution eu action plan toward zero pollution for air water and soil 
we must implement the exist eu regulatory framework protect air freshwater sea and ocean fast and good while urgently work toward a framework to regularly ass the statu of eu soil and take action at all level to addres soil pollution and degradation 
by 2030 the number of land and freshwater ecosystem where air pollutionrelated eutrophication threaten biodiversity must be reduce by 25 
when it come to freshwater and marine pollution achieve good statu under the water framework directive and the marine strategy framework directive would bring the eu close to realize the zero pollution ambition for all aquatic ecosystem 
the urban waste water treatment directive will in synergy with the evaluation of the sewage sludge directive help to increase the ambition level to remove nutrient from wastewater and make treat water and sludge ready for reuse support more circular le pollute farm 
a announce in the farm to fork and biodiversity strategy pollution from pesticide in air water and soil should be reduce by cut by 50 in 2030 their overall use and risk by 2030 75 of soil be healthy also thank to a specific objective on reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration 
in the framework of the eu soil strategy the commission will develop measure to significantly increase effort to identify investigate ass and remediate contaminate site so that by 2050 soil pollution will no long pose a health or environmental risk 
the industrial emission directive ied be the main instrument regulate air water and soil pollutant emission from over 52 000 of the large eu industrial installation embrace the zeropollution ambition in production and consumption also mean that chemical material and product have to be a safe and sustainable a possible by design and during their life cycle lead to nontoxic material cycle 
clearly the zeropollution transformation need not only fund and technology but also skilled person to make best use of both and thi hold true not just for digital skill the commission will implement the skill agenda amongst other by support the development of a core green skill set for the labor market to guide train acros the economy with a view to create a generation of climate environment and health consciou professional and green economic operator 
to help ensure that the green transition and sustainability become part of the education curriculum in 2021 the commission propose a council recommendation on education for environmental sustainability and a european competence framework for climate change and sustainable development 
the eu will also aim to ensure that pollution be effectively tackle a part of an ambitiou post 2020 global framework on biodiversity at the 15th conference of the party to the convention on biological diversity 
the commission will encourage partner country to improve their policy and regulatory framework and put in place the right incentive to reduce pollution notably through the use of green budget and environmental taxe furthermore the upcoming initiative on sustainable corporate governance will introduce due diligence duty acros economic value chain include environmental impact relate to busines operation 
the commission will promote global zero pollution in all relevant international forum and work with the eu member state and stakeholder to significantly reduce the eu external pollution footprint 
to integrate the monitor of different type of pollution and ass their health environmental economic and social impact the commission in partnership with relevant eu agency will develop an integrate zero pollution monitor and outlook framework a part of the wide 8th environment action program eap monitor 

2 air pollution control 
air pollution control represent the technique employ to reduce or eliminate the emission into the atmosphere of substance that can harm the environment or human health the control of air pollution be one of the principal area of pollution control along with wastewater treatment solidwaste management and hazardouswaste management 
air be consider to be pollute when it contain certain substance in concentration high enough and for duration long enough to cause harm or undesirable effect these include adverse effect on human health property and atmospheric visibility the atmosphere be susceptible to pollution from natural source a well a from human activity some natural phenomenon such a volcanic eruption and forest fire may have not only local and regional effect but also longlasting global one nevertheles only pollution cause by human activity such a industry and transportation be subject to mitigation and control 
most air contaminant originate from combustion process 
the criterium pollutant include fine particulate carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxide ozone and lead since the end of the 20th century there also ha be a recognition of the hazardou effect of trace amount of many other air pollutant call air toxic most air toxic be organic chemical comprise molecule that contain carbon hydrogen and other atom specific emission regulation have be implement against those pollutant in addition the longterm and farreaching effect of the greenhouse gase on atmospheric chemistry and climate have be observe and cooperative international effort have be undertake to control those pollutant the greenhouse gase include carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbon cfc methane nitrou oxide and ozone 
i mobile substance 
the chemical strategy for sustainability recognize the need to addres pollution from socalled persistent and mobile substance mobile substance be define a those that travel long distance with water include groundwater and can thu spread over large spatial and temporal scale example of persistent and mobile substance that be attract attention at the time of write include melamine benzotriazole 14dioxane and many per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfa a holistic approach be need whereby substance currently use in commerce be prioritize and strategy be then identify to prevent unnecessary exposure to these substance a holistic approach include not only an assessment of exposure hazard and risk but also require reflection regard product use scenario differentiate between essentialuse and nonessential use barrier represent by a lack of knowledge time and money can result in poorly inform decision which may present themself a regrettable substitution a more holistic sciencebased evaluation consider the whole life cycle of the persistent and mobile substance can help improve substitution decision by provide quantitative information regard the relative impact of a chemical ingredient throughout manufacture use and disposal 
the need to prioritize persistent and mobile substance for prevention and removal before exposure be too wide spread or before risk be too great be clear cost relate to identification screen and remediation of site contaminate with pfa acros europe be around 1020 billion per annum rise to 5284 billion per annum when cost such a increase healthcare demand ecological damage property los and impact on the agricultural sector be include removal of persistent and mobile substance from already pollute site be difficult 
give that these cost represent only a partial removal and that the method be resource intensive there be an urgent need to identify sustainable treatment technology able to remove persistent and mobile substance in the program horizon 2020 research and innovation action project call zero pm zero pollution of persistent mobile substance will interlink and synergize three strategy to protect the environment and human health from persistent mobile substance prevent prioritize and remove to prevent pollution of persistent and mobile substance zero pm will activate the momentum of the eu chemical strategy to support it implementation through the development of scientific policy and market tool for the substitution and mitigation of prioritize nonessential persistent and mobile substance to safe and sustainable alternative 
ius control of particulate 
the best way to protect air quality be to reduce the emission of pollutant by change to clean fuel and process pollutant not eliminate in thi way must be collect or trap by appropriate aircleaning device a they be generate and before they can escape into the atmosphere these device be describe below and design to remove particulate and gaseou pollutant from the emission of stationary source include power plant and industrial facility 
airborne particle can be remove from a pollute airstream by a variety of physical process common type of equipment for collect fine particulate include cyclone scrubber electrostatic precipitator and baghouse filter once collect particulate adhere to each other form agglomerate that can readily be remove from the equipment and dispose of usually in a landfill 
because each air pollution control project be unique it be usually not possible to decide in advance what the best type of particlecollection device or combination of device will be control system must be design on a casebycase basi important particulate characteristic that influence the selection of collection device include corrosivity reactivity shape density and especially size and size distribution the range of different particle size in the airstream other design factor include airstream characteristic eg pressure temperature and viscosity flow rate removal efficiency requirement and allowable resistance to airflow 
a cyclone separator fig 2 
in general cyclone collector be often use to control industrial dust emission and a precleaner for other kind of collection device a cyclone remove particulate by cause the dirty airstream to flow in a spiral path inside a cylindrical chamber dirty air enter the chamber from a tangential direction at the out wall of the device form a vortex a it swirl within the chamber the large particulate because of their great inertium move outward and be force against the chamber wall slow by friction with the wall surface they then slide down the wall into a conical dust hopper at the bottom of the cyclone the clean air swirl upward in a narrow spiral through an inner cylinder and emerge from an outlet at the top accumulate particulate dust be periodically remove from the hopper for disposal 
cyclone be best at remove relatively coarse particulate they can routinely achieve efficiency of 90 percent for particle large than about 20 micrometer m by themself however cyclone be not sufficient to meet stringent air quality standard they be typically use a precleaner and be follow by more efficient aircleaning equipment such a electrostatic precipitator and baghouse 

b wet scrubber fig 3 
a wet scrubber be an emission control device that abate particulate pm or gase use a scrub liquid the type of scrub liquid use be dependent on the target contaminant that need treatment the dirty exhaust stream be introduce into the scrubber vessel and interact with the scrub liquid wet scrubber be usually apply in the control of flammable or explosive dust or mist from such source a industrial and chemical process facility and hazardouswaste incinerator they can handle hot airstream and sticky particle 


c electrostatic precipitator fig 4 

electrostatic precipitator be a common particlecollection device at fossilfuel powergenerating station electrostatic precipitation be a commonly use method for remove fine particulate from airstream in an electrostatic precipitator particle suspend in the airstream be give an electric charge a they enter the unit and be then remove by the influence of an electric field the precipitation unit comprise baffle for distribute airflow discharge and collection electrode a dust cleanout system and collection hopper a high voltage of direct current dc a much a 100000 volt be apply to the discharge electrode to charge the particle which then be attract to oppositely charge collection electrode on which they become trap 
an electrostatic precipitator can remove particulate a small a 1 m with an efficiency exceed 99 percent the effectivenes of electrostatic precipitator in remove fly ash from the combustion gase of fossilfuel furnace account for their high frequency of use at power station 
d baghouse filter fig 5 

baghouse be employ an array of fabric bag for filter the airstream 
one of the most efficient device for remove suspend particulate be an assembly of fabricfilter bag commonly call a baghouse a typical baghouse comprise an array of long narrow bagseach about 25 cm in diameterthat be suspend upside down in a large enclosure dustladen air be blow upward through the bottom of the enclosure by fan particulate be trap inside the filter bag while the clean air pas through the fabric and exit at the top of the baghouse 
a fabricfilter dust collector can remove very nearly 100 percent of particle a small a 1 m and a significant fraction of particle a small a 001 m fabric filter however offer relatively high resistance to airflow which lead to substantial energy usage for the fan system in addition in order to prolong the useful life of the filter fabric the air to be clean must be cool 
iius control of gase 
gaseou pollutant a well a volatile organic compound voc and other gaseou air toxic be control by mean of three basic technique absorption adsorption and incineration or combustion these technique can be employ singly or in combination they be effective against the major greenhouse gase a well in addition a fourth technique know a carbon sequestration be in development a a mean of control carbon dioxide level 
absorption in the context of air pollution control absorption involf the transfer of a gaseou pollutant from the air into a contact liquid such a water the liquid must be able either to serve a a solvent for the pollutant or to capture it by mean of a chemical reaction 
wet scrubber and pack scrubber 
wet scrubber similar to those describe above for control suspend particulate may be use for ga absorption ga absorption can also be carry out in pack scrubber or tower in which the liquid be present on a wet surface rather than a droplet suspend in the air a common type of pack scrubber be the countercurrent tower after enter the bottom of the tower the pollute airstream flow upward through a wet column of light chemically inactive pack material the liquid absorbent flow downward and be uniformly spread throughout the column pack thereby increase the total area of contact between ga and liquid thermoplastic material be most widely use a pack for countercurrent scrubber tower these device usually have gasremoval efficiency of 9095 percent 
cocurrent and crossflow pack scrubber design be also use for ga absorption in the cocurrent design both ga and liquid flow in the same directionvertically downward through the scrubber although not a efficient a countercurrent design cocurrent device can work at high liquid flow rate the increase flow prevent plug of the pack when the airstream contain high level of particulate cocurrent design afford lower resistance to airflow and allow the crosssectional area of the tower to be reduce 
in general scrubber be use at fertilizer production facility to remove ammonium from the airstream at glas production plant to remove hydrogen fluoride at chemical plant to remove watersoluble solvent such a acetone and methyl alcohol and at render plant to control odor 
flue ga desulfurization fgd fig 6 
sulfur dioxide in flue ga from fossilfuel power plant can be control by mean of an absorption proces call flue ga desulfurization fgd fgd system may involve wet scrub or dry scrub in wet fgd system flue gase be bring in contact with an absorbent which can be either a liquid or a slurry of solid material the sulfur dioxide dissolf in or react with the absorbent and become trap in it in dry fgd system the absorbent be dry pulverize lime or limestone once absorption occur the solid particle be remove by mean of baghouse filter describe above dry fgd system compare with wet system offer cost and energy save and easy operation but they require high chemical consumption and be limit to flue gase derive from the combustion of lowsulfur coal 
fgd system be also classify a either regenerable or nonregenerable throwaway depend on whether the sulfur that be remove from the flue ga be recover or discard nonregenerable fgd system produce a sulfurcontaining sludge residue that require appropriate disposal regenerable fgd system require additional step to convert the sulfur dioxide into useful byproduct like sulfuric acid 


fig 6 wet scrubber use a limestone slurry to remove sulfur dioxide from flue ga 
several fgd method exist differ mainly in the chemical use in the proces fgd process that employ either lime or limestone slurry a the reactant be widely apply in the limestone scrub proces sulfur dioxide react with limestone calcium carbonate particle in the slurry form calcium sulfite and carbon dioxide in the lime scrub proces sulfur dioxide react with slake lime calcium hydroxide form calcium sulfite and water depend on sulfur dioxide concentration and oxidation condition the calcium sulfite can continue to react with water form calcium sulfate gypsum neither calcium sulfite nor calcium sulfate be very soluble in water and both can be precipitate out a a slurry by gravity settle the thick slurry call fgd sludge create a significant disposal problem flue ga desulfurization help to reduce ambient sulfur dioxide level and mitigate the problem of acid rain 
adsorption 
ga adsorption a contrast with absorption be a surface phenomenon the ga molecule be sorbedattracted to and heldon the surface of a solid ga adsorption method be use for odor control at variou type of chemicalmanufacturing and foodprocessing facility in the recovery of a number of volatile solvent eg benzene and in the control of voc at industrial facility 
activate carbon heat charcoal be one of the most common adsorbent material it be very porou and ha an extremely high ratio of surface area to volume activate carbon be particularly useful a an adsorbent for clean airstream that contain voc and for solvent recovery and odor control a properly design carbon adsorption unit can remove ga with an efficiency exceed 95 percent adsorption system be configure either a stationary bed unit or a move bed unit 
incineration 
the proces call incineration or combustionchemically rapid oxidationcan be use to convert voc and other gaseou hydrocarbon pollutant to carbon dioxide and water incineration of voc and hydrocarbon fume usually be accomplish in a special incinerator call an afterburner to achieve complete combustion the afterburner must provide the proper amount of turbulence and burn time and it must maintain a sufficiently high temperature sufficient turbulence or mix be a key factor in combustion because it reduce the require burn time and temperature a proces call direct flame incineration can be use when the waste ga be itself a combustible mixture and do not need the addition of air or fuel 
an afterburner typically be make of a steel shell line with refractory material such a firebrick the refractory line protect the shell and serve a a thermal insulator give enough time and high enough temperature gaseou organic pollutant can be almost completely oxidize with incineration efficiency approach 100 percent certain substance such a platinum can act in a manner that assist the combustion reaction these substance call catalyst allow complete oxidation of the combustible gase at relatively low temperature 
afterburner be use to control odor destroy toxic compound or reduce the amount of photochemically reactive substance release into the air they be employ at a variety of industrial facility where voc vapor be emit from combustion process or solvent evaporation eg petroleum refinery paintdrying facility and paper mill 
carbon sequestration 
the best way to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the air be to use energy more efficiently and to reduce the combustion of fossil fuel by use alternative energy source eg nuclear wind tidal and solar power in addition carbon sequestration can be use to serve the purpose carbon sequestration involf the longterm storage of carbon dioxide underground a well a on the surface of earth in forest and ocean carbon sequestration in forest and ocean rely on natural process such a forest growth however the clear of forest for agricultural and other purpose and also the pollution of ocean diminish natural carbon sequestration store carbon dioxide undergrounda technology under development that be also call geo sequestration or carbon capture and storagewould involve pump the ga directly into underground geologic reservoir layer thi would require the separation of carbon dioxide from power plant flue gase or some other sourcea costly proces 

3 water pollution 
water pollution represent the release of substance into subsurface groundwater or into lake stream river estuary and ocean to the point where the substance interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural function of ecosystem in addition to the release of substance such a chemical trash or microorganism water pollution may also include the release of energy in the form of radioactivity or heat into body of water 
when water become contaminate it ha detrimental effect on both animal and plant who rely on uncontaminated water and the sensitive water environment 
water pollution can come from any of the follow 
urban development 
the proces by which a lake change from a clean clear conditionwith a relatively low concentration of dissolve nutrient and a balance aquatic communityto a nutrientrich algaefilled state and thence to an oxygendeficient wastefilled condition be call eutrophication eutrophication be a naturally occur slow and inevitable proces however when it be accelerate by human activity and water pollution a phenomenon call cultural eutrophication it can lead to the premature age and death of a body of water 
the improper disposal of solid waste be a major source of water pollution solid waste include garbage rubbish electronic waste trash and construction and demolition waste all of which be generate by individual residential commercial institutional and industrial activity 
sewage wastewater 
domestic sewage be the primary source of pathogen diseasecausing microorganism and putrescible organic substance because pathogen be excrete in fece all sewage from city and town be likely to contain pathogen of some type potentially present a direct threat to public health putrescible organic matter present a different sort of threat to water quality a organic be decompose naturally in the sewage by bacterium and other microorganism the dissolve oxygen content of the water be deplete thi endanger the quality of lake and stream where high level of oxygen be require for fish and other aquatic organism to survive sewagetreatment process reduce the level of pathogen and organic in wastewater but they do not eliminate them completely 
mine 
marine dump 
oil leakage 
burn fossil fuel 
agriculture chemical fertilizer pesticide 
sewer leakage 
global warm 
radioactive waste 
animal waste 
acid rain 
there be no single or simple answer to stop the water pollution crisi however there be many solution to prevent water pollution both in my daily life and within industry 
we can separate the issue with water pollution into 10 notable solution 
wastewater treatment 
reduce plastic waste 
water conservation 
waterefficient toilet 
septic tank 
do not use the toilet a a trash bin 
stormwater management 
green agriculture wetland 
denitrification 
ozone wastewater treatment 
wastewater treatment 
treat water before it enter the waterway system be probably the most efficient way of reduce water pollution hit the issue right at the source 
wastewater treatment facility have the technology and tool to remove most pollutant through biological physical and chemical process for example sewage treatment allow water to travel through different sanitization chamber to reduce toxic level of water pollutant and prevent leakage into water system 
to ensure that wastewater treatment function properly regular maintenance of equipment be require thi include application such a water treatment sensor which be vital to measure and remove contaminant to reduce water pollution 
reduce plastic waste 
plastic waste be a huge issue more than 8 ton of plastic enter my ocean every year plu the plastic be to outweigh the number of fish by 2050 these fact be shock plastic waste also decay water supply thi be why it be extremely important to reduce plastic waste and improve sustainability both locally and globally 
plastic bottle and bag get most of the medium coverage but plastic be enter water system in way you cannot alway see and be most likely not aware of 
microplastic be a major issue and be find in 
industrial manufacture 
synthetic textile 
clothe 
personal care product toothpaste shampoo etc 
to reduce plastic waste at home we can do the follow 
recycle plastic 
use alternative to plastic like reusable utensil grocery bag etc 
shop locally and buy fruit vegetable not wrap in plastic 
buy organicnatural environmentallyfriendly care product 
water conservation 
water be a scarce resource so limit the amount of water you use daily will contribute to reduce water pollution 
septic tank 
septic tank be a great way to efficiently treat sewage separate solid from liquid septic tank degrade solid and allow liquid to flow into drainage system vium biological process 
use septic tank reduce water pollution by remove pollutant already present in water 
stormwater management 
treatment and management of stormwater vary from reverse osmosi ro advance oxidation and sand filtration 
green agriculture wetland 
agriculture be a huge industry worldwide use up to 70 of surface water supply to meet the demand of livestock production and farm 
a agriculture be such a large industry it be one of the primary cause of water pollution when it rain runoff transport pesticide and fertilizer 
agriculture can be environmentally friendly know a green agriculture green agriculture involf use pesticide and fertilizer that contain no harmful chemical it also include plant tree and create wetland to form buff zone which filter runoff and water pollutant 
denitrification 
when nitrate level be high in water it create the perfect environment for eutrophication or overfertilization from runoff to occur thi allow alga and phytoplankton in the water to rapidly grow reduce water quality and contribute to the water pollution issue 
denitrification be directly convert nitrate into nitrogen ga thi ecological proces prevent nitrate leach into soil and help reduce groundwater contamination 
ozone wastewater treatment 
although thi be also a wastewater treatment it go through a different proces to regular wastewater system which be why it be important to also note 
ozone wastewater treatment use an ozone generator to break down water pollutant ultraviolet uv radiation or an electric discharge field inside the generator convert oxygen into ozone thi proces oxidize bacterium organic matter and other water pollutant 
there be 7 way we can test water quality and reduce water pollution 
cdom color dissolve organic matterfdom fluorescent dissolve organic matter monitor 
chlorophyll fluorescence analysi 
conductivity salinity td total dissolve solid monitor 
measure water temperature 
measure do 
ph test 
evaluate turbidity t total suspend solid 

4 soil pollution management 
soil also commonly refer to a earth or dirt be a mixture of organic matter mineral gase liquid and organism that together support the life of plant and soil organism soil consist of a solid phase of mineral and organic matter the soil matrix a well a a porou phase that hold gase the soil atmosphere and water the soil solution accordingly soil be a threestate system of solid liquid and gase 
soil pollution refer to the presence of a chemical or substance out of place andor present in a soil at higherthannormal concentration that ha adverse effect on any nontargeted organism soil contamination soil pollution or land pollution a a part of land degradation be cause by the presence of xenobiotic humanmade chemical or other alteration in the natural soil environment 

fig 7 source of soil pollutant 
soil pollution can be cause by the follow nonexhaustive list 
microplastic 
oil spill 
mine and activity by other heavy industry 
accidental spill may happen during activity etc 
corrosion of underground storage tank include pip use to transmit the content 
acid rain 
intensive farm 
agrochemical such a pesticide herbicide and fertilizer 
petrochemical 
industrial accident 
road debris 
construction activity 
exterior leadbased paint 
drainage of contaminate surface water into the soil 
ammunition chemical agent and other agent of war 
waste disposal 
oil and fuel dump 
nuclear waste 
direct discharge of industrial waste to the soil 
discharge of sewage 
landfill and illegal dump 
coal ash 
electronic waste 
contaminate by rock contain large amount of toxic element 
contaminate by pb due to vehicle exhaust cd and zn cause by tire wear 
contamination by strengthen air pollutant by incineration of fossil raw material 
impact of soil pollution be not confine to soil and it biotum but be carry over to every aspect of the environment and affect every organism from the earthworm to human human health growth of plant air pollution diminish soil fertility impact on scene and odor contamination change in soil structure impact on ecosystem and biodiversity taint of water source 
soil remediation involf the elimination of contaminant from the soil through a range of chemical physical and biological mean that can be apply to carry it out 
in situ and ex situ soil remediation technology can be classify a physical biological chemical and combine approach wherea in situ soil remediation technology be aim at the decontamination of soil at it original site ex situ technology be perform through the excavation of the soil and decontaminate it away from it original site in situ remediation technology can involve chemical or biological process chemical remediation technology use chemical reagent and the mechanism involve include ion exchange catalysi adsorption oxidation and reduction in thi respect activate carbon have be widely use due to their capability to eliminate a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminant 
in situ soil remediation technology can be a favorable strategy for large scale of contaminate soil a it offer le disturbance to the ecosystem and be le cost effective these technology involve the supply and retrieval of fluid and reactant to the soil subsurface their effectivenes depend on soil condition and contaminant characteristic for instance chemical oxidation and bioventing be affect by soil permeability wherea conductive heat be not in situ bioremediation on the one hand supplement nutrient to the contaminate soil to stimulate soil microorganism to degrade pollutant alternatively new microorganism be introduce into the soil or native microorganism be enhance through genetic engineer to target specific pollution however the use of natural microorganism can be affect by inadequate nutrient supply andor the nature of contaminate site in situ bioremediation technique include bioabsorption compost bioventilation natural attenuation biopurification and microbialassisted phytoremediation physical soil remediation technology aim at stop or reverse environmental damage through the use of physical strategy such a flush cap thermal treatment for soil contaminate with svoc semivolatile organic compound thermal treatment can be a suitable method in situ cap be achieve by place a clean isolation material cover over the contaminate soil flush use a mixture of water and surfactant can be a more suitable and effective method of in situ remediation for soil contaminate with hydrophobic organic pollutant 
ex situ technology include the use of bio pile and slurry phase biological treatment amongst other in bio pile petroleum hydrocarbon contaminate soil be excavate and place in bio pile where they be mix with agent that promote the degradation proces at the treatment site the effectivenes of the proces can be improve by control aeration moisture temperature oxygen and ph slurry phase biological treatment be perform in a reactor contain a mixture of the excavate soil and water and nutrient be add to promote microorganism growth and activity that subsequently lead to the biodegradation of organic compound 

fig 8 soil remediation technology 
many benefit of biochar practice for soil remediation have be report such a increase carbon sequestration trend soil fertility biomas production crop yield and minimize emission of greenhouse gase biochar also renowned a biomassderived black carbon be become a valuable amendment for sustainable agriculture it be a recalcitrant carbonaceou material derive from biowaste matter combust under anaerobic condition which be an economical and ecofriendly method of carbon sequestration soil physiological property have be affect by use biochar with variou characteristic and application rate for soil amendment biochar can improve physicochemical and biological property of cultivate soil 
phytoremediation 
a novel approach to soil remediation be phytoremediation ie remediation by plant one type of phytoremediation be phytoextraction in which plant be use to take up contaminant and the plant be then harvest and treat or dispose of in thi proces most often propose for heavy metal and certain other inorganic contaminant such a arsenic a soil be plant with a specie that ha a high affinity for the contaminant such plant call hyperaccumulator mobilize metal from the soil and store them in plant tissue in many case these plant can transport the metal vium their vascular tissue to aboveground part such a stem and leaf which can be periodically harvest and dispose of in a secure manner in some case it be practical to recover the metal from the plant material by thi proces the metal contaminant be gradually remove from the soil often at a low cost than by alternative mean phytoremediation ha also be propose for some organic contaminant for example carbon tetrachloride ccl4 ha be show to be take up from soil porewater and dechlorinate by poplar tree
