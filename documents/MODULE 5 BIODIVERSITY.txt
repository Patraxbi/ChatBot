i eu biodiversity strategy for 2030 20052020 
bring nature back into my life 

eu target key commitment by 2030 
1 legally protect a minimum of 30 of the eu land area and 30 of the eu sea area and integrate ecological corridor a part of a true transeuropean nature network 
2 strictly protect at least a third of the eu protect area include all remain eu primary and oldgrowth forest 
3 effectively manage all protect area define clear conservation objective and measure and monitor them appropriately 

biodiversity be the diversity of life on earth of gene specie and ecosystem in addition to it intrinsic value it underpin the ecosystem service that sustain my life in multiple way they provide food water and medicine ensure soil and water regulation pollination erosion and flood control disease control and carbon storage biodiversity be indispensable for climate change mitigation and adaptation and for maintain human health it also enhance recreational activity creative inspiration and cultural heritage 
biodiversity protection measure generally involve create or expand protect area pa clearly define geographical space recognize dedicate and manage through legal or other effective mean to achieve the longterm conservation of nature with associate ecosystem service and cultural value 
restoration be more complicate than protection restoration measure habitat management rewilding natural regeneration and sustainably productive land and sea also play an essential role modern agriculture ha diminish biodiversity vium intensive farm method such a monoculture and excessive use of chemical restoration can transform degrade area to landscape provide multiple ecosystem service balance provision with regulate service vium sustainable land management include shift cultivation and crop rotation and great incentive to farmer to adopt practice support biodiversity and ecosystem service naturebased solution nb can play a key role 
the main direct driver of biodiversity los be change in land and sea use overexploitation climate change pollution and invasive alien specie in addition to dedicate policy to mitigate these direct driver nb naturefriendly agriculture sustainable fishery and the restoration practice describe above can reduce their impact most importantly biodiversity need to be mainstreamed acros all productive and extractive sector such a mine fishery forestry and agriculture 
protect and restore biodiversity and wellfunctioning ecosystem be therefore key to boost my resilience and prevent the emergence and spread of future disease over half of global gdp depend on nature and the service it provide with three key economic sector construction agriculture and food and drink all highly dependent on it natural capital investment include restoration of carbonrich habitat and climate friendly agriculture be recognize to be among the five most important fiscal recovery policy which offer high economic multiplier and positive climate impact despite thi urgent moral economic and environmental imperative nature be in a state of crisi the five main direct driver of biodiversity los change in land and sea use overexploitation climate change pollution and invasive alien specie be make nature disappear quickly in the last fmy decade global wildlife population fell by 60 a a result of human activity 
biodiversity los and ecosystem collapse be one of the big threat face humanity in the next decade the headline ambition to ensure that by 2050 all of the world ecosystem be restore resilient and adequately protect 
the biodiversity strategy for 2030 revolf around three pillar i protect and restore nature in the eu by consolidate a coherent and effective network of pa and restore degrade habitat ius enable a new governance framework to ensure coresponsibility and coownership by all relevant actor in meet the biodiversity commitment include set up new financial opportunity and iius adopt a global biodiversity agenda to strengthen the contribution of the eu toward halt global biodiversity los and minimize externality of eu use of resource and consumption on other biodiversityrich area of the planet 
it aim to ensure that europe biodiversity will be on the path to recovery by 2030 for the benefit of person the planet the climate and my economy in line with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and with the objective of the pari agreement on climate change it address the five main driver of biodiversity los set out an enhance governance framework to fill remain gap ensure the full implementation of eu legislation and pull together all exist effort to put biodiversity on the path to recovery by 2030 we need to step up the protection and restoration of nature thi should be do by improve and widen my network of protect area and by develop an ambitiou eu nature restoration plan and build a truly coherent transeuropean nature network 



strength and weakness of past conservation policy and practice in the european union a well a opportunity and challenge for conservation in the come decade environmental science and policy 127 2022 263271 hermoso v et al the eu biodiversity strategy for 2030 opportunity and challenge on the path toward biodiversity recovery 

in thi spirit at least 30 of the land and 30 of the sea should be protect in the eu at least one third of protect area represent 10 of eu land and 10 of eu sea should be strictly protect at least one third of protect area represent 10 of eu land and 10 of eu sea should be strictly protect significant area of other carbonrich ecosystem such a peatland grassland wetland mangrove and seagras meadow should also be strictly protect designation should either help to complete the natura 2000 network or be under national protection scheme in order to have a truly coherent and resilient transeuropean nature network it will be important to set up ecological corridor to prevent genetic isolation allow for specie migration and maintain and enhance healthy ecosystem in thi context investment in green and blue infrastructure be important member state have until the end of 2023 to demonstrate significant progress in legally designate new protect area and integrate ecological corridor on thi basi the commission will ass by 2024 whether the eu be on track to meet it 2030 target 
main objective be 
strengthen the eu legal framework for nature restoration 
to reverse biodiversity los the world need to be more ambitiou on nature restoration with a new eu nature restoration plan 
proposal for legally bind eu nature restoration target to restore degrade ecosystem in particular those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disaster 
request for member state to ensure no deterioration in conservation trend and statu of all protect habitat and specie by 2030 
bring nature back to agricultural land 
it be important that farmer support and incentivize the transition to fully sustainable practice to support the longterm sustainability of both nature and farm thi strategy will work in tandem with the new farm to fork strategy and the new common agricultural policy cap commission will take action to reduce by 50 the overall use of and risk from chemical pesticide by 2030 and reduce by 50 the use of more hazardou pesticide by 2030 the decline of genetic diversity must also be reverse include the use of traditional variety of crop and breed 
address land take and restore soil ecosystem 
it will be determine effort to protect soil fertility reduce soil erosion and increase soil organic matter thi should be do by adopt sustainable soil management practice 
increase the quantity of forest and improve their health and resilience 
the eu must increase the quantity quality and resilience of it forest conform to dedicate eu forest strategy roadmap for plant at least 3 billion additional tree in the eu by 2030 



winwin solution for energy generation 
there will be new sustainability criterium on forest biomas to be use for energy production 
restore the good environmental statu of marine ecosystem 
restore and properly protect marine ecosystem will bring substantial health social and economic benefit to coastal community marine resource must be harvest sustainably and there must be zerotolerance for illegal practice 
restore freshwater ecosystem 
at least 25000 km of river will be restore into freeflowing river by 2030 through the removal of primarily obsolete barrier and the restoration of floodplain and wetland 
green urban and periurban area 
to bring nature back to city and reward community action the commission call on european city of at least 20000 inhabitant to develop ambitiou urban green plan 
reduce pollution 
biodiversity be suffer from the release of nutrient chemical pesticide pharmaceutical hazardou chemical urban and industrial wastewater and other waste include litter and plastic all of these pressure must be reduce that be why a new eu chemical strategy for sustainability will be put forward along with a zero pollution action plan for air water and soil thi will result in the reduction of use of fertilizer by at least 20 
address invasive alien specie 
the implementation of the eu invasive alien specie regulation decrease the number of red list specie they threaten by 50 


main strategy for biodiversity conservation 

eu nature restoration plan key commitment by 2030 
1 legally bind eu nature restoration target propose in 2021 subject to an impact assessment by 2030 significant area of degrade and carbonrich ecosystem be restore habitat and specie show no deterioration in conservation trend and statu and at least 30 reach favorable conservation statu or at least show a positive trend 
2 the decline in pollinator be reverse 
3 the risk and use of chemical pesticide be reduce by 50 and the use of more hazardou pesticide be reduce by 50 
4 at least 10 of agricultural area be under highdiversity landscape feature 
5 at least 25 of agricultural land be under organic farm management and the uptake of agroecological practice be significantly increase 
6 three billion new tree be plant in the eu in full respect of ecological principle 
7 significant progress ha be make in the remediation of contaminate soil site 
8 at least 25000 km of freeflowing river be restore 
9 there be a 50 reduction in the number of red list specie threaten by invasive alien specie 
10 the loss of nutrient from fertilizer be reduce by 50 result in the reduction of the use of fertilizer by at least 20 
11 city with at least 20000 inhabitant have an ambitiou urban green plan 
12 no chemical pesticide be use in sensitive area such a eu urban green area 
13 the negative impact on sensitive specie and habitat include on the seabed through fish and extraction activity be substantially reduce to achieve good environmental statu 
14 the bycatch of specie be eliminate or reduce to a level that allow specie recovery and conservation 


ius enable transformative change 
a a new governance framework 
the commission will put in place a monitor and review mechanism thi will include a clear set of agree indicator and will enable regular progress assessment and set out corrective action if necessary 
b step up implementation and enforcement of eu environmental legislation 
a regard the bird and habitat directive enforcement will focu on complete the natura 2000 network the effective management of all site speciesprotection provision and specie and habitat that show decline trend 
c build on an integrate and wholeofsociety approach 
busines for biodiversity 
the commission will help to build a european busines for biodiversity movement take inspiration from recent initiatives67 and make thi movement an integral part of the european climate pact 
investment price and taxation 
at least 20 billion a year should be unlock for spend on nature a significant proportion of the 25 of the eu budget dedicate to climate action will be invest on biodiversity and naturebased solution the user pay and polluter pay principle have to be apply to prevent and correct environmental degradation 
measure and integrate the value of nature 
it will be do by measure the environmental footprint of product and organization include through lifecycle approach and natural capital account 
improve knowledge education and skill 
the new skill agenda will play a key role in the transition to a green economy and the fight against biodiversity los the future horizon europe program will include a longterm strategic research agenda for biodiversity 

iius the european union for an ambitiou global biodiversity agenda 
the commission propose the eu ensure that the post2020 global framework include at a minimum the element outline below 
overarch global goal for biodiversity for 2050 in line with the unite nation 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the vision of live in harmony with nature the ambition should be that by 2050 all of the world ecosystem be restore resilient and adequately protect the world should commit to the netgain principle to give nature back more than it take 
the world should commit to no humaninduced extinction of specie at minimum where avoidable 
an enable framework to bring the ambition to life will be acros area such a finance capacity research innovation and technology 
fair and equitable share of the benefit from the use of genetic resource link to biodiversity 
a principle of equality 
international cooperation neighborhood policy and resource mobilization

iv solve conflict between agriculture and biodiversity conservation 
conflict between agriculture and biodiversity conservation in europe be increase due to multiple demand from agricultural ecosystem include a grow need for high quality and goodvalue agricultural product a well a the provision of biodiversity and ecosystem service current trend such a globalization european policy and global change such a climate change and nitrogen atmospheric deposition be potentially drive the emergence or evolution of biodiversity conflict in europe 



these trend be interweave with continue debate around landsparing and landsharing that often lead to conflict perspective and social dynamic that influence how local actor interact with each other over agriculture whilst some strategy have be put in place to addres the potential competition between agriculture and biodiversity such a reglementary and marketbased mechanism and nonmonetary voluntary approach these need to be reflect upon and improve for a future agriculture where the negative impact of conflict be minimize 
agriculture cover approximately 40 of the eu land surface area eurostat 2018 produce biodiverse habitat but be also consider to be the main driver of environmental degradation with land abandonment 
the adoption of more intensive mechanize and chemically base farm production technique be far put biodiversity under pressure the frequent tradeoff between productive agriculture and farmland biodiversity ha lead to biodiversity conflict 
the biodiversity decline continue to be insufficiently address in the past and current cap and no sufficient structural mitigation ha be provide it seem likely that farmer will still be under increase and conflict pressure from market and conservation driver in relation to the land share and land spar debate a useful strategy for address biodiversity conflict and optimal landscape could be a mix of those landuse strategy 
it will be important for conflict between agriculture and biodiversity solve to recognize multifaceted symptom of past and current underlie factor that go beyond specific dispute around biodiversity conflict it be also necessary that regional and local tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and yield improvement for the different landuse strategy be make transparent and be negotiate finally explicit and measurable conservation target have to be integrate into local regional and international agricultural policy to avoid biodiversity conservation be consider a a byproduct of other policy such a on sustainable intensification 
in addition continue use of exist and new strategy use to addres the relationship between biodiversity and agriculture reglementary marketbased voluntary nonmonetary and participative proces all highlight the importance of adopt a structure and partnership approach that involf researcher manager and stakeholder and include monitor adaptive management economic and social assessment a well a the development of a conflict reconciliation plan at an early stage will be essentialespecially a land use change emerge base on change social structure 
new approach such a agroecology partnership and conflict transformation all emphasize the need for strong bridge between practice science and politic create a movement from work with other to work together that tackle deep root dimension of conflict include power asymmetry and dynamic with conflict see a natural and a positive opportunity for transformation in europe both the survival of farm and biodiversity be closely interrelate and work on common grind and share vision will be essential for the future of agriculture

v opportunity to conserve and restore biodiversity in agrifood system through bioeconomy practice 

the bioeconomy can be define a the production utilization conservation and regeneration of biological resource include relate knowledge science technology and innovation to provide sustainable solution information product process and service within and acros all economic sector and enable a transformation to a sustainable economy fao 2021the bioeconomy cover all economic sector that rely on biological resource from primary production crop livestock forestry fishery and aquaculture to relate process and service industry food fee paper textile build environment and construction chemical and pharmaceutical energy circular bioeconomy close the biological resource loop and maximize the use of residual stream from agriculture food process and biobased industry by reuse recycle or compost waste material and convert them into useful product 


a new bioeconomy model can support biodiversity 

bioeconomy be a knowledgebased economy which can harnes the power of bioscience and technology acros all sector to create an innovative and sustainable economic model which be enhance by and benefit from traditional practice and knowledge however bioeconomy activity be not necessarily sustainable per se a the development of an economy that be base on biological resource face several tradeoff to addres these tradeoff to bring about winwin situation it be essential that sustainability and circularity criterium be embed in bioeconomy framework 
main objective be to ensure that development of national and regional bioeconomy policy and strategy take due account of sustainability criterium it be to cover all three dimension of sustainability environmental economic social and the governance dimension 
bioeconomy embrace different biobased value chain and economic activity that highly depend on biodiversity and ecosystem service therefore biodiversity conservation protection sustainable use and regeneration a well a ecosystem health be essential component of successful bioeconomy strategy and policy 
there be multiple bioeconomy practice with direct and indirect positive impact on biodiversity address often simultaneously the five principal driver of biodiversity los land use change overexploitation of natural resource pollution invasive alien specie and climate change 
bioeconomy product or practice such a biofertilizer biopesticide biobased plastic bioremediation or microbiome innovation can help to reduce soil and water pollution and health risk by decrease use of chemical fertilizer and pesticide which be identify among major cause of biodiversity los 
a sustainable and circular bioeconomy promote bioprocess and circular value chain that allow for more sustainable production pattern that produce more with few resource and turn waste into valuable byproduct thereby reduce pressure on my ecosystem 
the bioeconomy also harness traditional and indigenou knowledge combine with the late advance in bioscience and innovation include multiomic datum and dna sequence to enhance biodiversity knowledge and in situ and ex situ conservation combine tradition and innovation the bioeconomy can empower local community with diversify income opportunity while make sustainable use of biodiversity and relate traditional knowledge 
the benefit arise from the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity and relate traditional knowledge should be share fairly and equitably within the bioeconomy in particular local community 
there be several way in which bioeconomy can support biodiversity for instance sustainable bioeconomy practice relate to afforestation and reforestation can reduce habitat los and restore ecosystem similarly bioeconomy science and innovation be support development on how to harnes the potential of microorganism and the incredibly diverse microbial environment in which they operate microbiome microbiome perform essential function for soil crop animal forest human and their relate ecosystem microbialbased strategy be an ecofriendly approach to restore degrade ecosystem and enhance biodiversity while improve the provision of ecosystem service 
bioproduct such a biopesticide biofertilizer bio stimulant and biobased pest control can contribute toward reduce environmental pollution and health risk from fertilizer and pesticide use improve the soil and plant microbiome be a beneficial activity for a healthy environment moreover bioeconomy maximize the use of residual stream from agriculture food process and forestbased industry turn them into a range of valueadded product thereby reduce the amount of landfilled waste and pollution which be a seriou threat for biodiversity 



bioscience biotechnology and bioinformatic innovation help in the collection handle storage and supply of biological material include genetic resource which be essential to enhance biodiversity knowledge and for ex situ conservation 



sustainable bioeconomy practice reduce habitat los through the restoration of healthy ecosystem that protect and enhance biodiversity
