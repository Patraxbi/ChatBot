eu target there be two major objective a increase energy efficiency b replace the fossil fuel use to generate energy by green sustainable source of energy 
the revise energy efficiency directive eu20231791 publish in the official journal on 20 september 2023 significantly raise the eu ambition on energy efficiency 
it establish energy efficiency first a a fundamental principle of eu energy policy give it legalstanding for the first time in practical term thi mean that energy efficiency must be consider by eu country in all relevant policy and major investment decision take in the energy and nonenergy sector 
the 2023 revision of the directive follow a proposal for a recast directive on energy efficiency put forward by the commission in july 2021 a part of the eu green deal package the 2021 proposal wa far enhance a part of the repower eu plan present by the commission 
the 2023 revise directive raise the eu energy efficiency target make it bind for eu country to collectively ensure an additional 117 reduction in energy consumption by 2030 compare to the 2020 reference scenario projection a a result overall eu energy consumption by 2030 should not exceed 9925 million ton of oil equivalent mtoe for primary energy and 763 mtoe for final energy 
the revise directive more than double the annual energy save obligation article 8 by 2028 thi be one of the key policy instrument of the directive to meet the headline target and to drive energy save in enduse sector such a build industry and transport 
support to new highefficiency cogeneration unit use natural ga and connect to district heat in efficient district heat and cool system will only be possible until 2030 wherea any other fossil fuel use will be ban for new heat generation capacity in such system eu country will also have to promote local heat and cool plan in large municipality have population above 45 000 
green sustainable energy definition 
a sunburst chart be show the share of different type of fuel in electricity generation in the eu in 2022 394 of electricity wa generate from renewable energy source 387 from fossil fuel and 219 from nuclear power

fig 2 the structure of renewable source generate electricity in eu in 2020 source eurostat 
person often use the term sustainable and renewable interchangeably however there be a difference between the two the possibility of replenishment 
sustainable energy a highlight above be theoretically inexhaustible it cannot be deplete because sustainable energy source dont need to be replenish for example think of the sun or wind neither resource need to be create or replace 
on the other hand renewable energy be theoretically exhaustible it use resource from the earth that can naturally be replenish such a crop and biomatter a renewable energy source like bioenergy use biological mass eg agricultural byproduct like straw and manure to create energy conversion of waste into valueadded product such a energy transform a potential environmental problem into a sustainable solution the topic energy from waste production and storage focuse on the conversion of waste from variou source for use in energy production and storage application it provide the stateoftheart in develop advance material and chemical for energy application use waste and discus the variou treatment process and technology 
cover synthesi of usable material from variou type of waste and their application in energy production and storage 
present an overview and application of waste for green energy production and storage 
provide fundamental of electrochemical behavior and understand of energy device such a fuel cell battery supercapacitor and solar cell 
elaborate on advance technology use to convert waste into green biochemical energy 
in the light of such consideration convert food agriculture or municipal waste to useful energy be become a reasonable and economic topic the opportunity of apply food waste a a suitable feedstock to produce biofuel be in progress the conversion of waste be achieve vium biological treatment involve compost anaerobic digestion and fermentation there be also thermal or thermochemical technology involve incineration pyrolysi gasification plasma treatment and hydrothermal carbonization transesterification and bio electrochemical treatment 
sustainable energy include any energy source that cannot be deplete and can remain viable forever it do not need to be renew or replenish sustainable energy meet my demand for energy without any risk of go bad or run out thi be why sustainable energy be the answer to my energy need 
furthermore sustainable energy doesnt harm the environment or at most there be a minimal risk increase climate change or cost a heavy price although there be a cost associate with create and build way to capture sustainable energy the energy source themself be typically free 
fossil fuel eg coal natural ga and oil be not only harmful to the planet when burn daily for energy but theyre also unsustainable a finite resource sustainability refer to the concept that all person can meet their basic need infinitely without compromise future generation sustainability in term of energy embrace the same principle 


fig 3 green energy be generate from infinite source that do not produce carbon emission or harm the environment 
sustainable energy be generate from source that replenish themself fast than they be deplete know the difference between the two aid in the fight against global climate change green and sustainable energy source be alternative to fossil fuel eg coal oil natural ga that aid in the fight against global climate change because they help curtail ghg emission 
both green and sustainable energy source be in infinite supply but only green energy source have the add benefit of not produce ghg emission or negatively impact the environment 
basically all green energy be sustainable energy but not all sustainable energy be green energy green energy come from source that provide the high environmental benefit wherea sustainable source can be harvest indefinitely 


fig 4 characterization of green versu sustainable versu renewable versu clean energy type 

green energy be a more specific category of renewable energy that provide high environmental benefit than renewable it can also reduce carbon footprint air pollution and water environmental cost however green energy posse geographic limitation and offer intermittent production peak depend on weather condition 
sustainable energy aim to limit ghg emission while preserve the natural integrity of the environment an energy source can be sustainable a long a the rate of resource harvest stay below the rate of natural resource replenishment harvest utilize operate and build infrastructure be all area where the energy could become unsustainable 
green energy be important for the environment a it replace the negative effect of fossil fuel with more environmentallyfriendly alternative derive from natural resource green energy be also often renewable and clean mean that they emit no or few greenhouse gase and be often readily available 
even when the full life cycle of a green energy source be take into consideration they release far le greenhouse gase than fossil fuel a well a few or low level of air pollutant thi be not just good for the planet but be also good for the health of person and animal that have to breathe the air 
green energy can also lead to stable energy price a these source be often produce locally and be not a affect by geopolitical crisi price spike or supply chain disruption the economic benefit also include job creation in build the facility that often serve the community where the worker be employ renewable energy saw the creation of 11 million job worldwide in 2018 with thi number set to grow a we strive to meet target such a net zero 
due to the local nature of energy production through source like solar and wind power the energy infrastructure be more flexible and le dependent on centralize source that can lead to disruption a well a be le resilient to weather relate climate change 
many industry be investigate green solution and here be a few example 
heat and cool in build 
green energy solution be be use for build range from large office block to people home these include solar water heater biomas fuel boiler and direct heat from geothermal a well a cool system power by renewable source 
industrial process 
renewable heat for industrial process can be run use biomas or renewable electricity hydrogen be now a large provider of renewable energy for the cement iron steel and chemical industry 
transport 
sustainable biofuel and renewable electricity be grow in use for transportation acros multiple industry sector automotive be an obviou example a electrification advance to replace fossil fuel but aerospace and construction be other area that be actively investigate electrification 
green energy ha the capacity to replace fossil fuel in the future however it may require vary production from different mean to achieve thi 
can it be economically viable 
understand the economic viability of green energy require a comparison with fossil fuel the fact be that a easilyreached fossil resource begin to run out the cost of thi type of energy will only increase with scarcity 
at the begin of the 21st century about 80 percent of the world energy supply wa derive from fossil fuel such a coal petroleum and natural ga fossil fuel be finite resource most estimate suggest that the prove reserve of oil be large enough to meet global demand at least until the middle of the 21st century fossil fuel combustion ha a number of negative environmental consequence fossilfueled power plant emit air pollutant such a sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen oxide and toxic chemical heavy metal mercury chromium and arsenic and mobile source such a fossilfueled vehicle emit nitrogen oxide carbon monoxide and particulate matter exposure to these pollutant can cause heart disease asthma and other human health problem in addition emission from fossil fuel combustion be responsible for acid rain which ha lead to the acidification of many lake and consequent damage to aquatic life leaf damage in many forest and the production of smog in or near many urban area furthermore the burn of fossil fuel release carbon dioxide co2 one of the main greenhouse gase that cause global warm 
at the same time a the fossil fuel become more expensive the cost of green energy source be fall other factor also work in favor of green energy such a the ability to produce relatively inexpensive localize energy solution such a solar farm the interest investment and development of green energy solution be bring cost down a we continue to build up my knowledge and be able to build on past breakthrough 
in the follow part the renewable energy solution will be develop mean green and sustainable or only renewable it be usable energy derive from replenishable source such a the sun solar energy wind wind power river hydroelectric power hot spring geothermal energy tide tidal power biomas biofuel green hydrogen by the electrolysi of water and solid waste biotransformation into energy by circular bioeconomy solution 
thi last subject will be develop in the next module dedicate to circular economy bioeconomy 
there be important benefit of renewable energy 
1 improve public health 
the burn of fossil fuel in coal and natural ga plant be directly tie with many seriou public health issue such a neurological damage cancer heart attack breathe problem and premature death when fossil fuel be burn for energy they release air and water pollution that negatively affect surround community and environment 
however all of these associate risk can be eliminate by switch to sustainable energy sustainable energy source typically emit no air or water pollutant that can harm public health they also dont make a negative impact or strain on local water resource meanwhile coal mine natural ga drill and thermal power plant all compete with local agriculture drink water and other important community water need for resource 
2 create local job 
sustainable energy can also help fuel ymy local community since most facility and sustainable energy infrastructure must be build locally or in the same county make the switch help create job and improve the economy instead of spend more money import energy from fossil fuel company that money be spend on material and workmanship to maintain sustainable energy facility 
3 decrease ymy carbon footprint 
be all do my best to reduce my negative impact on the environment but there be only so much each person can do sustainable energy such a wind and solar energy create zero carbon emission that can harm the atmosphere and contribute to global warm it offset the need for fossil fuel which be actively increase climate change and pollute my earth 
simply switch ymy own home energy source can help cut the environmental impact you and ymy family have on the planet and eliminate ymy dependence on fossil fuel 
4 longterm cost be more affordable 
sustainable energy can make a huge longterm difference to the electricity and energy cost of my home and business no matter where you be not only be they easily available for little to no cost but theyre much more costeffective than traditional energy resource such a power plant make the financial leap to wind solar or any other sustainable energy source may seem daunt at first because of installation cost but the longterm investment pay off in just a few year in fact sustainable energy cost decrease each and every year depend on ymy country or state you may even get tax reduction for choose sustainable energy ultimately you could end up save exponentially just by make the switch to a sustainable energy system like solar panel 
5 energy security 
sustainable energy be by definition the most reliable form of energy it will never deplete and can remove my reliance on import fossil fuel which be grow more expensive and le accessible sustainable energy also help to conserve the planet natural resource and reduce the pollution associate with unsustainable energy 
the economic efficiency 
currently wind farm be see a the most efficient source of green energy a it require le refine and process than the production of for example solar panel advance in composite technology and test ha help improve the lifespan and therefore the energy cost of wind turbine however the same can be say of solar panel which be also see a great deal of development 
renewable energy source be currently rank a follow in efficiency although thi may change a development continue 
1 wind power 
2 geothermal 
3 hydropower 
4 nuclear to remind clean energy a a matter of fact 
5 solar power 
for the other type of renewable energy source the comparison be under scrutiny depend on the technological advancement 
renewable energy source account for nearly 20 percent of global energy consumption at the begin of the 21st century largely from traditional use of biomas such a wood for heat and cook by 2015 about 16 percent of the world total electricity come from large hydroelectric power plant wherea other type of renewable energy such a solar wind and geothermal account for 6 percent of total electricity generation some energy analyst consider nuclear power to be a form of renewable energy because of it low carbon emission nuclear power generate 106 percent of the world electricity in 2015 
growth in wind power exceed 20 percent and photovoltaic grow at 30 percent annually in the 1990 and renewable energy technology continue to expand throughout the early 21st century between 2001 and 2017 world total instal wind power capacity increase by a factor of 22 grow from 23900 to 539581 megawatt photovoltaic capacity also expand increase by 50 percent in 2016 alone the european union eu which produce an estimate 638 percent of it energy from renewable source in 2005 adopt a goal in 2007 to raise that figure to 20 percent by 2020 by 2016 some 17 percent of the eu energy come from renewable source the goal also include plan to cut emission of carbon dioxide by 20 percent and to ensure that 10 percent of all fuel consumption come from biofuel the eu wa well on it way to achieve those target by 2017 between 1990 and 2016 the country of the eu reduce carbon emission by 23 percent and increase biofuel production to 55 percent of all fuel consume in the region 

fig 5 barrier to renewable energy development 
technical barrier be mainly concern with the technology to harvest available and viable renewable energy resource rer thi start from rer availability feasibility and viability infrastructure grid connectivity and capacity the human factor of skilled labor and technical expertise 
the term variable renewable energy vre be usually use to refer to solar and wind rer due to their high intermittent nature compare to other rer in thi regard storage energy system s have be widely view a an ultimate solution to smooth the rer power generation scheme 
the european commission ha set up a fair transition mechanism to finance the green reform to a climateneutral economy thi mechanism consist of three main source of fund 1 a just transition fund which will be finance with new community fund of 75 billion in addition to the commission proposal for the next longterm budget of the european union 2 a special regime of fair transition within the framework of invest eu for the mobilization of investment and find new source of growth and 3 a public sector lend mechanism in cooperation with the european investment bank 
wind power 
by 2016 wind wa contribute approximately 4 percent of the world total electricity electricity generation by wind ha be increase dramatically because of concern over the cost of petroleum and the effect of fossil fuel combustion on the climate and environment from 2007 to 2016 for example total instal wind power capacity quintuple from 95 gigawatt to 487 gigawatt worldwide in 2016 denmark generate the large percentage of it electricity from wind nearly 38 percent the wind power industry estimate that the world could feasibly generate nearly 20 percent of it total electricity from wind power by 2030 variou estimate put the cost of wind energy a low a 26 cent per kilowatthmy depend on the location thi be comparable to the cost of coal natural ga and other form of fossil energy which range between 5 and 17 cent per kilowatthmy 
challenge to the largescale implementation of wind energy include sit requirement such a wind availability aesthetic and environmental concern and land availability wind farm be most costeffective in area with consistent strong wind however these area be not necessarily near large population centre thu power line and other component of electrical distribution system must have the capacity to transmit thi electricity to consumer in addition since wind be an intermittent and inconsistent power source store power may be necessary public advocacy group have raise concern about the potential disruption that wind farm may have on wildlife and overall aesthetic although wind generator have be blame for injure and kill bird expert have show that modern turbine have a small effect on bird population the national audubon society a large environmental group base in the unite state and focus on the conservation of bird and other wildlife be strongly in favmy of wind power provide that wind farm be appropriately sit to minimize the impact on migrate bird population and important wildlife habitat 
in the case of wind energy the most common and widely apply conversion approach be to convert wind energy into electrical energy use wind turbine couple with an electrical generator 

fig 5 wind turbine structure source encyclopedium britanica 
while largescale wind turbine be a mature technology that can be sit within or close to city where good wind resource be identify smallscale wind turbine sit on or near build be still emerge small wind turbine be currently more costly and le efficient than large one and will require far development if they be to make a noticeable contribution to urban energy supply 
a major challenge for urban small wind will continue to be proper sit and cost control due to their small scale and relative cost longterm wind speed monitor can be impractical for these project 
look to the future a wind energy and other form of variable renewable generation increase flexible energy resource will likely be need to keep supply and demand on the grid in balance energy storage technology and demand response will be among the option for provide thi flexibility in a lowcarbon energy system battery flywheel compress air and other form of energy storage may be utilize to store renewable power when it be in exces for future use when demand would otherwise exceed supply however the viability of energy storage a a grid balance solution will depend on the cost of these technology a compare to available alternative smart grid investment in advance meter and appliance capable of send and receive signal to control electricity demand in real time be one such alternative indeed a renewable supply that fluctuate with change in wind or solar availability become ubiquitou it will become more important that the electric grid be an intelligent and dynamic energy system capable of utilize a number of different option and technique for control supply and demand 
despite the fact that wind energy technology be highly popular there be certain issue that limit it use the efficiency and practical usability of wind energy technology depend on the reliability and lifetime of wind turbine the repair and maintenance of wind turbine be typically quite expensive and labor consume 
issue with regard to the environment and public perception be also important 
noise pollution noise be disturb for some person there be two main source of noise from a wind turbine mechanical noise from the gearbox and generator and aerodynamic noise from the rotor blade aerodynamic noise be the major component of the total noise and resemble the swish sound create by a helicopter at 400 m downwind the turbine noise can be a high a 60 db which be comparable to the noise level from an air conditioner or dishwasher however the noise from wind farm be far below the threshold of pain which be 140 db furthermore noise ha be reduce substantially with the advent of new and improve design wind turbine 
aesthetic some person perceive wind farm a ugly for the landscape force developer to install them in remote area include offshore 
bird collision some instance of bird collide with the rotate blade be report however the problem can be reduce to a great extent with new turbine be design with low blade speed 
ice accumulation in cold weather region ice can accumulate on the blade when the turbine spin the ice can be dislodge and such projectile endanger the public and structure in the vicinity in some model the blade be heat to avoid the ice from accumulate on them 
it be to work with industry partner to increase the performance and reliability of nextgeneration wind technology while lower the cost of wind energy the office research effort have help to increase the average capacity factor a measure of power plant productivity from 22 for wind turbine instal before 1998 to an average of nearly 35 today up from 30 in 2000 wind energy cost have be reduce from over 55 cent current dollar per kilowatthmy kwh in 1980 to an average of under 3 cent per kwh in the usa today to ensure future industry growth wind industry technology must continue to evolve build on early success to far improve reliability increase capacity factor and reduce cost 
solar energy 
solar energy be determine by the radiation from the sun capable of produce heat cause chemical reaction or generate electricity the total amount of solar energy incident on earth be vastly in exces of the world current and anticipate energy requirement if suitably harness thi highly diffuse source ha the potential to satisfy all future energy need in the 21st century solar energy be expect to become increasingly attractive a a renewable energy source because of it inexhaustible supply and it nonpolluting character 
solar energy be available everywhere and be already commercially apply in several sector either solar thermal or electrical energy the widespread of solar photovoltaic pv system require efficient energy storage system battery be the most affordable energy storage that be available in different size 

fig 6 reflection and absorption of solar energy source merriamwebster inc 
the sun be an extremely powerful energy source and sunlight be by far the large source of energy receive by earth but it intensity at earth surface be actually quite low thi be essentially because of the enormou radial spread of radiation from the distant sun a relatively minor additional los be due to earth atmosphere and cloud which absorb or scatter a much a 54 percent of the incoming sunlight the sunlight that reach the grind consist of nearly 50 percent visible light 45 percent infrared radiation and small amount of ultraviolet and other form of electromagnetic radiation 
the potential for solar energy be enormou since about 200000 time the world total daily electricgenerating capacity be receive by earth every day in the form of solar energy unfortunately though solar energy itself be free the high cost of it collection conversion and storage still limit it exploitation in many place solar radiation can be convert either into thermal energy heat or into electrical energy though the former be easy to accomplish 



fig 7 photovoltaic power potential on earth source encyclopedium britanica 
a thermal energy 

fig 8 a build roof with flatplate collector that capture solar energy to heat air or water 
among the most common device use to capture solar energy and convert it to thermal energy be flatplate collector which be use for solar heat application because the intensity of solar radiation at earth surface be so low these collector must be large in area even in sunny part of the world temperate region for instance a collector must have a surface area of about 40 square meter to gather enough energy to serve the energy need of one person 
the most widely use flatplate collector consist of a blacken metal plate cover with one or two sheet of glas that be heat by the sunlight fall on it thi heat be then transfer to air or water call carrier fluid that flow past the back of the plate the heat may be use directly or it may be transfer to another medium for storage flatplate collector be commonly use for solar water heater and house heat the storage of heat for use at night or on cloudy day be commonly accomplish by use insulate tank to store the water heat during sunny period such a system can supply a home with hot water draw from the storage tank or with the warm water flow through tube in floor and ceiling it can provide space heat flatplate collector typically heat carrier fluid to temperature range from 66 to 93 c the efficiency of such collector ie the proportion of the energy receive that they convert into usable energy range from 20 to 80 percent depend on the design of the collector 
another method of thermal energy conversion be find in solar pond which be body of salt water design to collect and store solar energy the heat extract from such pond enable the production of chemical food textile and other industrial product and can also be use to warm greenhouse swim pool and livestock build solar pond be sometime use to produce electricity through the use of the organic rancow cycle engine a relatively efficient and economical mean of solar energy conversion which be especially useful in remote location solar pond be fairly expensive to install and maintain and be generally limit to warm rural area 
on a small scale the sun energy can also be harness to cook food in specially design solar oven solar oven typically concentrate sunlight from over a wide area to a central point where a blacksurfaced vessel convert the sunlight into heat the oven be typically portable and require no other fuel input 
b electricity generation 
solar radiation may be convert directly into electricity by solar cell photovoltaic cell in such cell a small electric voltage be generate when light strike the junction between a metal and a semiconductor such a silicon or the junction between two different semiconductor the power generate by a single photovoltaic cell be typically only about two watt by connect large number of individual cell together however a in solarpanel array hundred or even thousand of kilowatt of electric power can be generate in a solar electric plant or in a large household array the energy efficiency of most presentday photovoltaic cell be only about 15 to 20 percent and since the intensity of solar radiation be low to begin with large and costly assembly of such cell be require to produce even moderate amount of power 
when sunlight strike a solar cell an electron be free by the photoelectric effect the two dissimilar semiconductor posse a natural difference in electric potential voltage which cause the electron to flow through the external circuit supply power to the load the flow of electricity result from the characteristic of the semiconductor and be power entirely by light strike the cell 


fig 9 photovoltaic solar cell source encyclopedium britanica 
small photovoltaic cell that operate on sunlight or artificial light have find major use in lowpower applicationsa power source for calculator and watch for example large unit have be use to provide power for water pump and communication system in remote area and for weather and communication satellite classic crystalline silicon panel and emerge technology use thinfilm solar cell include buildingintegrated photovoltaic can be instal by homeowner and business on their rooftop to replace or augment the conventional electric supply 


a concentrate solar power plant 
b solar reflector 


fig 10 solar power unit source encyclopedium britanica 
concentrate solar power plant employ concentrate or focus collector to concentrate sunlight receive from a wide area onto a small blacken receiver thereby considerably increase the light intensity in order to produce high temperature the array of carefully align mirror or lense can focu enough sunlight to heat a target to temperature of 2000 c or more thi heat can then be use to operate a boiler which in turn generate steam for a steam turbine electric generator power plant for produce steam directly the movable mirror can be arrange so a to concentrate large amount of solar radiation upon blacken pipe through which water be circulate and thereby heat 
solar energy be also use on a small scale for purpose other than those describe above in some country for instance solar energy be use to produce salt from seawater by evaporation similarly solarpowered desalination unit transform salt water into drink water by convert the sun energy to heat directly or indirectly to drive the desalination proces 
solar technology ha also emerge for the clean and renewable production of hydrogen a an alternative energy source mimic the proces of photosynthesi artificial leaf be siliconbased device that use solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen leave virtually no pollutant far work be need to improve the efficiency and costeffectivenes of these device for industrial use 
with the technological development in solar panel the efficiency of commercial module ha reach 1222 the lack of expect improvement in the efficiency of thinfilm solar panel ha significantly reduce in the market share of these panel in addition the increase in the cost of len and track system in concentrate pv module ha decrease the market share of these system therefore new study be carry out to increase cell and module efficiency 
solar panel can perform a part of my energy need fig 11 show the evolution of renewable energy annual installation over the last 11 year the development of solar energy among renewable energy source can be see in thi figure solar panel have show an everincreasing market growth in electricity generation thank to their technology and price in fact solar energy see a for approximately 40 of the total renewable electricity generation in 2021 







fig 11 evolution of renewable energy annual installation global level source world bank 

the benefit arise from the installation and operation of solar energy system be environmental and socioeconomical 
from an environmental point of view the use of solar energy technology ha several positive implication which include a reduction of the emission of the greenhouse gas mainly co2 nox and of toxic ga emission so2 particulate b reclamation of degrade land c reduce requirement for transmission line within the electricity grid d improvement of the water resource quality 
the socioeconomic benefit of solar technology include a increase regionalnational energy independence b creation of employment opportunity c restructure of energy market due to penetration of a new technology and the growth of new production activity d diversification security and stability of energy supply e acceleration of electrification of rural community in isolate area 
it be worth note that no artificial project can completely avoid some impact to the environment the negative environmental aspect of solar energy system include a pollution stem from production installation maintenance and demolition of the system b noise during construction c land displacement d visual intrusion 
consider a 60 transmittance through the atmospheric cloud cover 105105 tw reach the earth surface continuously if the irradiance on only 1 of the earth surface could be convert into electric energy with a 10 efficiency it would provide a resource base of 105 tw while the total global energy need for 2050 be project to be about 2530 tw the present state of solar energy technology be such that single solar cell efficiency have reach over 20 with concentrate pv at about 40 and solar thermal system provide efficiency of 4060 
solar pv panel have come down in cost from about 30 w1 to about 3 w1 in the last three decade at 3 w1 panel cost the overall system cost be around 6 w1 which be still too high for the average consumer however there be many offgrid application where solar pv be already costeffective with net meter and governmental incentive such a feedin law and other policy gridconnected application such a buildingintegrated photovoltaic bipv have become costeffective a a result the worldwide growth in pv production be more than 30 per year average during the past 5 year 
solar thermal power use concentrate solar collector wa the first solar technology that demonstrate it grid power potential progress in solar thermal power stall after that time because of poor policy and lack of rd however the last 5 year have see a resurgence of interest in thi area and a number of solar thermal power plant around the world be under construction the cost of power from these plant which be so far in the range of 012016 kwh1 ha the potential to go down to 005 kwh1 with scaleup and creation of a ma market an advantage of solar thermal power be that thermal energy can be store efficiently and fuel such a natural ga or bioga may be use a backup to ensure continuou operation 
in thi volume emphasi be give to solar thermal system solar thermal system be nonpolluting and offer significant protection to the environment the reduction of greenhouse gas be the main advantage of utilize solar energy therefore solar thermal system should be employ whenever possible in order to achieve a sustainable future 
in term of technology solar photovoltaic pv be a perfect example of technological advancement the 3rd generation solar pv cell be currently employ and they overcome many of the challenge associate with energy efficiency and cost the advancement in solar pv cell have lead to low cost le energyintensive manufacture process and the use of available material resource ie avoid the use of preciou metal one of the main challenge of pv project be their connectivity to the power grid which be mainly due to their intermittent nature 
hydropower 
a the second large renewable electricity source hydropower continue to be an important energy source today accord to eurostat it account in 2021 for 32 of the eu renewable electricity production and provide 12 of the eu electricity

hydroelectric power late only call hydropower be a renewable energy source where electrical energy be derive from the potential energy of water move from high to low elevation 
hydroelectric power be electricity produce from generator drive by turbine that convert the potential energy of fall or fastflowing water into mechanical energy in the early 21st century hydroelectric power wa the most widely utilize form of renewable energy in 2019 it account for more than 18 percent of the world total power generation capacity 
in the generation of hydroelectric power water be collect or store at a high elevation and lead downward through large pipe or tunnel penstock to a low elevation the difference in these two elevation be know a the head at the end of it passage down the pipe the fall water cause turbine to rotate the turbine in turn drive generator which convert the turbine mechanical energy into electricity transformer be then use to convert the alternate voltage suitable for the generator to a high voltage suitable for longdistance transmission the structure that house the turbine and generator and into which the pipe or penstock fee be call the powerhouse 


fig 15 hydroelectric power plant structure source encyclopedium britanica 
hydroelectric power plant be usually locate in dam that impound river thereby raise the level of the water behind the dam and create a high a head a be feasible the potential power that can be derive from a volume of water be directly proportional to the work head so that a highhead installation require a small volume of water than a lowhead installation to produce an equal amount of power in some dam the powerhouse be construct on one flank of the dam part of the dam be use a a spillway over which exces water be discharge in time of flood where the river flow in a narrow steep gorge the powerhouse may be locate within the dam itself 
in most community the demand for electric power vary considerably at different time of the day to even the load on the generator pumpedstorage hydroelectric station be occasionally build during offpeak period some of the extra power available be supply to the generator operate a a motor drive the turbine to pump water into an elevate reservoir then during period of peak demand the water be allow to flow down again through the turbine to generate electrical energy pumpedstorage system be efficient and provide an economical way to meet peak load 
hydroelectric power be the large and cheap renewable electricity source in the world although biomas easily surpass it when other energy application be consider even so hydroelectric power release no direct greenhouse ga emission and be a significant source of power in many part of the world 
hydroelectric power ha certain advantage over these other source it be continually renewable owe to the recur nature of the hydrologic cycle it do not produce thermal pollution however some dam can produce methane from the decomposition of vegetation under water hydroelectric power be a prefer energy source in area with heavy rainfall and with hilly or mountainou region that be in reasonably close proximity to the main load center some large hydro site that be remote from load center may be sufficiently attractive to justify the long highvoltage transmission line small local hydro site may also be economical particularly if they combine storage of water during light load with electricity production during peak it require relatively high initial investment but ha a long life span with very low operation and maintenance cost it be a prove mature predictable and price competitive technology hydropower ha the best conversion efficiency among all know energy source about 90 efficiency water to wire hydropower ha an energy payback ratio of 200300 high of all type of renewable energy hydropower can provide both energy and water management service and also help to support other variable renewable energy source such a wind and solar by provide storage and load balance service 
many of the negative environmental impact of hydroelectric power come from the associate dam which can interrupt the migration of spawn fish such a salmon and permanently submerge or displace ecological and human community a the reservoir fill in addition hydroelectric dam be vulnerable to water scarcity thi be not to say that hydro power be without adverse environmental impact however largescale dam be well know to lead to significant ecological damage include los of biodiversity localize deforestation soil erosion and disruption of freeflowing river a well a displacement of large number of human in many case

tidal and wave power 
the move water from large lake sea and ocean form wave produce by wind or tide can be use to generate electric power 
a tidal power 
tidal energy be a form of power produce by the natural rise and fall of tide cause by the gravitational interaction between earth the sun and the moon tidal current with sufficient energy for harvest occur when water pas through a constriction cause the water to move fast 
tidal energy be produce by the surge of ocean water during the rise and fall of tide tidal energy be a renewable source of energy during the 20th century engineer develop way to use tidal movement to generate electricity in area where there be a significant tidal rangethe difference in area between high tide and low tide all method use special generator to convert tidal energy into electricity tidal energy production be still in it infancy the amount of power produce so far ha be small there be very few commercialsized tidal power plant operate in the world the first wa locate in la rance france the large tidal plant and only a few site where tidal energy could be produce at a reasonable price 
tidal energy generator 
there be currently three different way to get tidal energy tidal stream barrage and tidal lagoon 
for most tidal energy generator turbine be place in tidal stream a tidal stream be a fastflowing body of water create by tide a turbine be a machine that take energy from a flow of fluid that fluid can be air wind or liquid water because water be much dense than air tidal energy be more powerful than wind energy unlike wind tide be predictable and stable where tidal generator be use they produce a steady reliable stream of electricity 
place turbine in tidal stream be complex because the machine be large and disrupt the tide they be try to harnes the environmental impact could be severe depend on the size of the turbine and the site of the tidal stream turbine be most effective in shallow water thi produce more energy and allow ship to navigate around the turbine a tidal generator turbine blade also turn slowly which help marine life avoid get catch in the system the world first tidal power station wa construct in 2007 at strangford lough in northern ireland the turbine be place in a narrow strait between the strangford lough inlet and the irish sea the tide can move at 4 meter per second acros the strait 
another type of tidal energy generator use a large dam call a barrage with a barrage water can spill over the top or through turbine in the dam because the dam be low barrage can be construct acros tidal river bay and estuary turbine inside the barrage harnes the power of tide the same way a river dam harness the power of a river the barrage gate be open a the tide rise at high tide the barrage gate close create a pool or tidal lagoon the water be then release through the barrage turbine create energy at a rate that can be control by engineer 
the environmental impact of a barrage system can be quite significant the land in the tidal range be completely disrupt the change in water level in the tidal lagoon might harm plant and animal life the salinity inside the tidal lagoon low which change the organism that be able to live there a with dam acros river fish be block into or out of the tidal lagoon turbine move quickly in barrage and marine animal can be catch in the blade with their food source limit bird might find different place to migrate a barrage be a much more expensive tidal energy generator than a single turbine although there be no fuel cost barrage involve more construction and more machine unlike single turbine barrage also require constant supervision to adjust power output the tidal power plant at the rance river estuary in brittany france use a barrage it wa build in 1966 and be still function the plant use two source of energy tidal energy from the english channel and river current energy from the rance river the barrage ha lead to an increase level of silt in the habitat native aquatic plant suffocate in silt and a flatfish call plaice be now extinct in the area other organism such a cuttlefish a relative of squid now thrive in the rance estuary cuttlefish prefer cloudy silty ecosystem 
the final type of tidal energy generator involf the construction of tidal lagoon a tidal lagoon be a body of ocean water that be partly enclose by a natural or manmade barrier tidal lagoon might also be estuary and have freshwater empty into them a tidal energy generator use tidal lagoon would function much like a barrage unlike barrage however tidal lagoon can be construct along the natural coastline a tidal lagoon power plant could also generate continuou power the turbine work a the lagoon be fill and empty the environmental impact of tidal lagoon be minimal the lagoon can be construct with natural material like rock they would appear a a low breakwater sea wall at low tide and be submerge at high tide animal could swim around the structure and small organism could swim inside it large predator like shark would not be able to penetrate the lagoon so small fish would probably thrive bird would likely flock to the area but the energy output from generator use tidal lagoon be likely to be low there be no function example yet 

fig 16 tidal power generate system source encyclopedium britanica 
globally tidal power could potentially produce between 150 and 800 terawatt hour of renewable energy per yearat the upper end that more than canada energy production from wind water nuclear fossil fuel and other source combine in 2019 
for tidal power generation location be everything to produce energy tidal generator need fast current or a sizable swing in sea level between high tide and low tide 
b wave power 
wave power be also renewable energy represent the capture of energy of wind wave to do useful work for example electricity generation water desalination or pump water 

fig 17 wave power 
there be several method of harness wave energy that involve place electricity generator on the surface of the ocean 
wave power be typically produce by float turbine platform or buoy that rise and fall with the swell however wave power can be generate by exploit the change in air pressure occur in wave capture chamber that face the sea or change in wave pressure on the ocean floor 
the area of great potential for wave energy development be in the latitude with the high wind latitude 4060 n and s on the eastern shore of the world ocean which border the western edge of the continent for instance the world first operational wave power generator be locate off the coast of aguadora portugal produce a much a 225 megawatt from three huge joint tube that float on the surface of the atlantic ocean individual power generator be locate at the tube joint and activate by wave motion 

fig 18 float turbine to produce wave power 
despite the enormou energy potential of wave power technical challenge remain research fund be low compare with that support solar wind and other renewable form of energy and thu the proces of experimentation and refinement with different wave energy collector design be not a well develop the development of massive machine for use in the ocean be expensive salt water in the ocean corrode steel and other metal and the physical force of the wave fatigue wave energy collector transmission wire and other infrastructure over time 
geothermal energy 
geothermal energy be a natural resource and form of energy conversion in which heat energy from within earth be capture and harness for cook bath space heat electrical power generation and other use 
heat from earth interior generate surface phenomenon such a lava flow geyser fumarole hot spring and mud pot the heat be produce mainly by the radioactive decay of potassium thorium and uranium in earth crust and mantle and also by friction generate along the margin of continental plate the subsequent annual lowgrade heat flow to the surface average between 50 and 70 milliwatt mw per square meter worldwide in contrast incoming solar radiation strike earth surface provide 342 watt per square meter annually see solar energy geothermal heat energy can be recover and exploit for human use and it be available anywhere on earth surface the estimate energy that can be recover and utilize on the surface be 45 106 exajoule or about 14 106 terawattyear which equate to roughly three time the world annual consumption of all type of energy 
the amount of usable energy from geothermal source vary with depth and by extraction method the increase in temperature of rock and other material underground average 2030 c kilometer depth worldwide in the upper part of the lithosphere and thi rate of increase be much high in most of earth know geothermal area normally heat extraction require a fluid or steam to bring the energy to the surface locate and develop geothermal resource can be challenge thi be especially true for the hightemperature resource need for generate electricity such resource be typically limit to part of the world characterize by recent volcanic activity or locate along plate boundary or within crustal hot spot even though there be a continuou source of heat within earth the extraction rate of the heat fluid and steam can exceed the replenishment rate and thu use of the resource must be manage sustainably 
use 
geothermal energy use can be divide into three category directuse application geothermal heat pump ghp and electric power generation 
direct use 
probably the most widely use set of application involf the direct use of heat water from the grind without the need for any specialize equipment all directuse application make use of lowtemperature geothermal resource which range between about 50 and 150 c such lowtemperature geothermal water and steam have be use to warm single build a well a whole district where numerou build be heat from a central supply source in addition many swim pool balneological therapeutic facility at spa greenhouse and aquaculture pond around the world have be heat with geothermal resource other direct use of geothermal energy include cook industrial application such a dry fruit vegetable and timber milk pasteurization and largescale snow melt for many of those activity hot water be often use directly in the heat system or it may be use in conjunction with a heat exchanger which transfer heat when there be problematic mineral and gase such a hydrogen sulfide mix in with the fluid 
geothermal heat pump 
geothermal heat pump ghp take advantage of the relatively stable moderate temperature condition that occur within the first 300 meter of the surface to heat build in the winter and cool them in the summer in that part of the lithosphere rock and groundwater occur at temperature between 5 and 30 c at shallow depth where most ghp be find such a within 6 meter of earth surface the temperature of the grind maintain a nearconstant temperature of 10 to 16 c consequently that heat can be use to help warm build during the cold month of the year when the air temperature fall below that of the grind similarly during the warm month of the year warm air can be draw from a build and circulate underground where it losis much of it heat and be return 


fig 19 residential heat pump operation for summer cool and winter heat source encyclopedium britannica 
a ghp system be make up of a heat exchanger a loop of pipe bury in the grind and a pump the heat exchanger transfer heat energy between the grind and air at the surface by mean of a fluid that circulate through the pipe the fluid use be often water or a combination of water and antifreeze during warm month heat from warm air be transfer to the heat exchanger and into the fluid a it move through the pipe the heat be disperse to the rock soil and groundwater the pump be reverse during the cold month heat energy store in the relatively warm grind raise the temperature of the fluid the fluid then transfer thi energy to the heat pump which warm the air inside the build 
ghp have several advantage over more conventional heat and airconditioning system they be very efficient use 2550 percent le electricity than comparable conventional heat and cool system and they produce le pollution the reduction in energy use associate with ghp can translate into a much a a 44 percent decrease in greenhouse ga emission compare with airsource heat pump which transfer heat between indoor and outdoor air in addition when compare with electric resistance heat system which convert electricity to heat couple with standard airconditioning system ghp can produce up to 72 percent le greenhouse ga emission 
electric power generation 
depend upon the temperature and the fluid steam flow geothermal energy can be use to generate electricity geothermal power plant can produce electricity in three way despite their difference in design all three control the behavior of steam and use it to drive electrical generator give that the exces water vapor at the end of each proces be condense and return to the grind where it be reheat for late use geothermal power be consider a form of renewable energy 

fig 20 dry steam geothermal power generation source encyclopedium britannica 
some geothermal power plant simply collect rise steam from the grind in such dry steam operation the heat water vapor be funnel directly into a turbine that drife an electrical generator other power plant build around the flash steam and binary cycle design use a mixture of steam and heat water wet steam extract from the grind to start the electrical generation proces 

fig 21 flash steam geothermal power generation source encyclopedium britannica 


fig 22 binarycycle geothermal power generation source encyclopedium britannica 
in flash steam power plant pressurize hightemperature water be draw from beneath the surface into container at the surface call flash tank where the sudden decrease in pressure cause the liquid water to flash or vaporize into steam the steam be then use to power the turbinegenerator set in contrast binarycycle power plant use steam drive off a secondary work fluid such a ammonium and hydrocarbon contain within a close loop of pipe to power the turbinegenerator set in thi proces geothermally heat water be draw up through a different set of pipe and much of the energy store in the heat water be transfer to the work fluid through a heat exchanger the work fluid then vaporize after the vapor from the work fluid pas through the turbine it be recondensed and pip back to the heat exchanger 
electrical power usually require water heat above 175 c to be economical in geothermal plant use the organic rancow cycle orc a special type of binarycycle technology that utilize lowertemperature heat source such a biomas combustion and industrial waste heat water temperature a low a 8590 c may be use 
exhaustion 
geothermal resource can be exhaust if the rate of heat extraction exceed the rate of natural heat recharge normally geothermal resource can be use for 20 to 30 year however the energy output may decrease with time make continue development uneconomical with proper management geothermal resource can be sustainable for many year and they can even recover if use be suspend for a period of time 
economic environmental issue 
compare the benefit of geothermal energy with other renewable energy source the main advantage of geothermal energy be that it base load be available 24 hour per day 7 day per week wherea solar and wind be available only about onethird of the time in addition the cost of geothermal energy vary between 5 and 10 cent per kilowatthmy which can be competitive with other energy source such a coal the main disadvantage of geothermal energy development be the high initial investment cost in construct the facility and infrastructure and the high risk of prove the resource geothermal resource in lowpermeability rock be often find and exploration activity often drill dry holesthat be hole that produce steam in amount too low to be exploit economically however once the resource be prove the annual cost of fuel that be hot water and steam be low and tend not to escalate in price

situation in eu 
geothermal represent 05 of the global renewable electricity market in 2022 generate 02 of electricity in the eu 
in a project call geothermica which involf specialist analyst and financier from 13 country the eu throw in a budget of eur 30 million for small and large project use geothermal energy for heat cool and electricity generation like the wind the boil water from the grind would have the potential to contribute to the green of the air we breathe a in the case of any other energy source consider for variou social economic and especially political argument a savior geothermal energy be still dress in the in the garb of nonpolluting righteousnes but in term of geothermal water the eu do not hold such substantial reserve a to witnes a new gold rush a it happen with wind energy 


fig 24 geothermal energy use function of temperature source www crowdthermalprojectcom 
the few european state that fall into such a rank be iceland or italy with almost 1000 mw the leader of the eu bloc in thi respect germany also ha a number of intention to use thi type of energy but for now at small scale with exist unit of le than 40 mw while portugal hold 30 mw in geothermal energy the geothermal energy instal in the eu can supply about 2 million home 
the use of geothermal energy in europe be expect to grow rapidly over the next decade since thi energy resource be generally abundant ubiquitou versatile lowcarbon and nonintermittent the researcher from the abovementioned project have expand and adapt the integrate assessment model tiamecn to more adequately reflect geothermal energy potential and to good represent the variou sector in which geothermal energy could possibly be use with the update version of tiamecn they quantify how large the share of geothermal energy in europe could grow until 2050 and analyze how thi expansion could be stimulate by climate policy and technological progress they investigate geothermal energy two main application power and heat production for the former an increase to around 100210twhyear in 2050 can be expect depend on assumption regard climate ambition and cost reduction for enhance geothermal resource system for the latter with application in residential commercial industrial and agricultural sector one can anticipate under the same assumption a rise to about 8801050twhyear in 2050 one can estimate that by the middle of the century geothermal energy plant could contribute approximately 47 to european electricity generation a european geothermal energy investment market supply plu demand side possibly worth about 160210 billion usyear by midcentury can be foresee

biomas biofuel 
definition biofuel be consider any fuel that be derive from biomassthat be plant or alga material or animal waste since such feedstock material can be replenish readily biofuel be consider to be a source of renewable energy unlike fossil fuel such a petroleum coal and natural ga biofuel be commonly advocate a a costeffective and environmentally benign alternative to petroleum and other fossil fuel particularly within the context of rise petroleum price and increase concern over the contribution make by fossil fuel to global warm many critic expres concern about the scope of the expansion of certain biofuel because of the economic and environmental cost associate with the refine proces and the potential removal of vast area of arable land from food production 
other definition be biofuel be biobased product in solid liquid or gaseou form they be produce from crop or natural product such a wood or agricultural residue such a mola and bagasse 
highlight iea bioenergy task 39 
the eu27 supply of biofuel in 2020 wa around 16 millionl1 ton of oil equivalent mtoe which account for 63 of the total transport fuel consumption in the eu about 85 of biofuel supply come from primary production within the eu 
in 2020 the overall eu production of biofuel wa 20 billion liter per year of which 15 billion liter about 13 mtoe biodiesel and 5 billion liter about 3 mtoe bioethanol most biofuel be conventional biofuel produce from vegetable oil a rapeseed sugar beet and maize but a grow amount of them be produce from feedstock such a use cook oil reach more than 4 mtoe in 2020 represent around 25 of total biofuel consumption of thi 12 mtoe be advance biofuel produce from lignocellulosic feedstock with a limit plan production up to 185 mty 
after the covid19 period the production of liquid biofuel for road transport remain almost constant but a rapid market uptake be expect in the come year in particular for advance biofuel a biomethane and aviation biofuel 
new policy mechanism have be promote to stimulate the production of biofuel in particular the fitfor55 package revise the red ius and set more ambitiou target for ghg emission reduction by 2030 the package also introduce specific target for nonbiological fuel aviation and maritime biofuel 
a part of the re power eu plan the ec propose in may 2022 to far increase the share of energy from renewable source in the gros final consumption of energy to 45 by 2030 re power eu be the action for substitute fossil fuel reduce the dependence on russian fossil fuel and accelerate europe clean energy transition to far deployment of renewable 
re power eu ha also set a goal to promote renewable gase such a hydrogen and biomethane and in particular to increase biomethane production to 35 bcm billion cubic meter by 2030 to replace natural ga import 
advance biofuel be expect to play an increase role in transport a subtarget for advance biofuel supply to the transport sector wa set at 02 in 2022 1 in 2025 and 35 in 2030 integrate the addition of a double count for these fuel more ambition target be currently revise give the necessity for a high greenhouse ga emission reduction from transport sector

economic and environmental consideration 
in evaluate the economic benefit of biofuel the energy require to produce them ha to be take into account for example the proces of grow corn to produce ethanol consume fossil fuel in farm equipment in fertilizer manufacture in corn transportation and in ethanol distillation in thi respect ethanol make from corn represent a relatively small energy gain the energy gain from sugarcane be great and that from cellulosic ethanol or alga biodiesel could be even great 
biofuel also supply environmental benefit but depend on how they be manufacture can also have seriou environmental drawback a a renewable energy source plantbased biofuel in principle make little net contribution to global warm and climate change the carbon dioxide a major greenhouse ga that enter the air during combustion will have be remove from the air early a grow plant engage in photosynthesi such a material be say to be carbon neutral in practice however the industrial production of agricultural biofuel can result in additional emission of greenhouse gase that may offset the benefit of use a renewable fuel these emission include carbon dioxide from the burn of fossil fuel during the production proces and nitrou oxide from soil that ha be treat with nitrogen fertilizer in thi regard cellulosic biomas be consider to be more beneficial 
land use be also a major factor in evaluate the benefit of biofuel the use of regular feedstock such a corn and soybean a a primary component of firstgeneration biofuel spark the food versu fuel debate in divert arable land and feedstock from the human food chain biofuel production can affect the economic of food price and availability in addition energy crop grow for biofuel can compete for the world natural habitat for example emphasi on ethanol derive from corn be shift grassland and brushland to corn monoculture and emphasi on biodiesel be bring down ancient tropical forest to make way for oil palm plantation los of natural habitat can change the hydrology increase erosion and generally reduce biodiversity of wildlife area the clear of land can also result in the sudden release of a large amount of carbon dioxide a the plant matter that it contain be burn or allow to decay 
some of the disadvantage of biofuel apply mainly to lowdiversity biofuel sourcescorn soybean sugarcane oil palmswhich be traditional agricultural crop one alternative involf the use of highly diverse mixture of specie convert degrade agricultural land that be out of production to such highdiversity biofuel source could increase wildlife area reduce erosion cleanse waterborne pollutant store carbon dioxide from the air a carbon compound in the soil and ultimately restore fertility to degrade land such biofuel could be burn directly to generate electricity or convert to liquid fuel a technology develop 
one distinctive promise of biofuel be that in combination with an emerge technology call carbon capture and storage the proces of produce and use biofuel may be capable of perpetually remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere under thi vision biofuel crop would remove carbon dioxide from the air a they grow and energy facility would capture the carbon dioxide give off a biofuel be burn to generate power capture carbon dioxide could be sequester store in longterm repository such a geologic formation beneath the land in sediment of the deep ocean or conceivably a solid such a carbonate 
eu regulation biofuel and bioga in coprocessed fuel 
the commission adopt in june 2023 new rule establish the share of biofuel and bioga in mix fuel coprocessed use biobased and fossilbased raw material and that can count toward the renewable energy directive target for renewable in transport the delegate regulation eu20231640 wa publish in the official journal of the eu on 18 august 2023 and ha be subject to public feedback several consultation and scrutiny from the european parliament and the council 
under the renewable energy directive eu country be oblige to ensure that the share of renewable energy in the final consumption of energy in transport be at least 14 by 2030 include a minimum share of 35 of advance biofuel 
they be also require to set out an obligation on fuel supplier that ensure the achievement of thi target 
sustainability criterium 
the revise renewable energy directive eu20232413 provide an overarch policy for the promotion and use of energy from renewable source in the eu it also reinforce the sustainability criterium of bioenergy through different provision include the negative direct impact that the production of biofuel may have due to indirect land use change 
while biofuel be important in help the eu meet it greenhouse ga reduction target biofuel production typically take place on cropland that wa previously use for agriculture to grow food or fee since thi agricultural production be necessary biofuel production may lead to the extension of agricultural land into noncrop land possibly include area with high carbon stock such a forest wetland and peatland thi proces be know a indirect land use change iluc a it may cause the release of co2 store in tree and soil iluc pose a risk to the greenhouse ga save that result from increase production of biofuel 
to addres the issue of iluc the revise directive introduce a new approach by set limit on high ilucrisk biofuel bioliquid and biomas fuel with a significant expansion in land with high carbon stock these limit affect the amount of these fuel that eu country can count toward their national target when calculate the overall national share of renewable and the share of renewable in transport eu country will still be able to use and import fuel cover by these limit but they will not be able to include these volume when calculate the extent to which they have fulfil their renewable target these limit impose a freeze equivalent to 2019 level for the period 20212023 which will gradually decrease from the end of 2023 to zero by 2030 the directive also introduce an exemption to these limit for biofuel bioliquid and biomas fuel certify a low ilucrisk 
for the implementation of thi approach a require by the directive the commission adopt the delegate regulation on indirect landuse change eu 2019807 in which it lay down provision to determine the high ilucrisk feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high carbon stock be observe it also set out criterium to certify low ilucrisk biofuel bioliquid and biomas fuel 
furthermore specific rule and methodological guidance for certification of low ilucrisk biofuel bioliquid and biomas fuel have be include in the implement regulation on sustainability certification propose by the commission in line with article 308 of the revise directive the implement regulation receive on a positive vote by the committee on the sustainability of biofuel bioliquid and biomas fuel on 10 march 2022 and wa publish in the official journal on 27 june 2022 
quality standard for biofuel 
work together with the european committee for standardization cen the eu aim to develop and improve the technical quality standard of biofuel and biofuel blend for vehicle engine the practical work be carry out by cen technical committee 19 consist of expert from the automotive and fuel industry biofuel producer and other stakeholder 
the commission may decide by mean of an implement act that report submit by eu country and by country outside the eu contain accurate datum for the purpose of measure the greenhouse ga emission associate with the cultivation of biofuel and bioliquid feedstock typically produce in those area 
in general biofuel emit few greenhouse ga emission when burn in an engine and be generally consider carbonneutral fuel a the carbon emit ha be capture from the atmosphere by the crop use in production however lifecycle assessment of biofuel have show large emission associate with the potential landuse change require to produce additional biofuel feedstock estimate about the climate impact from biofuel vary widely base on the methodology and exact situation examine therefore the climate change mitigation potential of biofuel vary considerably in some scenario emission level be comparable to fossil fuel and in other scenario the biofuel emission result in negative emission 
type of biofuel 
some longexploited biofuel such a wood can be use directly a a raw material that be burn to produce heat the heat in turn can be use to run generator in a power plant to produce electricity a number of exist power facility burn gras wood or other kind of biomas 
liquid biofuel be of particular interest because of the vast infrastructure already in place to use them especially for transportation 
a liquid biofuel 
a the liquid biofuel in great production be ethanol ethyl alcohol which be make by ferment starch or sugar unlike the firstgeneration ethanol biofuel produce from food crop secondgeneration cellulosic ethanol be derive from lowvalue biomas that posse a high cellulose content include wood chip crop residue and municipal waste cellulosic ethanol be commonly make from sugarcane bagasse a waste product from sugar process or from variou grass that can be cultivate on lowquality land give that the conversion rate be low than with firstgeneration biofuel cellulosic ethanol be dominantly use a a gasoline additive 
biologically produce alcohol most commonly ethanol and le commonly propanol and butanol be produce by the action of microorganism and enzyme through the fermentation of sugar or starch easy or cellulose which be more difficultthe iea estimate that ethanol production use 20 of sugar supply and 13 of corn supply in 2021 
ethanol fuel be the most common biofuel worldwide alcohol fuel be produce by fermentation of sugar derive from wheat corn sugar beet sugar cane mola and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverage can be make such a potato and fruit waste etc the ethanol production method use be enzyme digestion to release sugar from store starch fermentation of the sugar distillation and dry the distillation proces require significant energy input for heat sometime unsustainable natural ga fossil fuelbut pellet wood chip and also waste heat be more common in europe waste steam fuel ethanol factory where waste heat from the factory also be use in the district heat grid corntoethanol and other food stock ha lead to the development of cellulosic ethanol 
other bio alcohol 
methanol be currently produce from natural ga a nonrenewable fossil fuel in the future it be hop to be produce from biomas a bio methanol thi be technically feasible but the production be currently be postpone for concern that the economic viability be still pending the methanol economy be an alternative to the hydrogen economy to be contrast with today hydrogen production from natural ga 
butanol be form by abe fermentation acetone butanol ethanol and experimental modification of the proces show potentially high net energy gain with biobutanol a the only liquid product biobutanol be often claim to provide a direct replacement for gasoline because it will produce more energy than ethanol and allegedly can be burn straight in exist gasoline engine without modification to the engine or car escherichium coli strain have also be successfully engineer to produce butanol by modify their amino acid metabolism one drawback to butanol production in e coli remain the high cost of nutrient rich medium however recent work ha demonstrate e coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation 
b biodiesel 
the second most common liquid biofuel be biodiesel which be make primarily from oily plant such a the soybean or oil palm and to a less extent from other oily source such a waste cook fat from restaurant deepfrying biodiesel which ha find great acceptance in europe be use in diesel engine and usually blend with petroleum diesel fuel in variou percentage the use of alga and cyanobacterium a a source of thirdgeneration biodiesel hold promise but ha be difficult to develop economically some algal specie contain up to 40 percent lipid by weight which can be convert into biodiesel or synthetic petroleum some estimate state that alga and cyanobacterium could yield between 10 and 100 time more fuel per unit area than secondgeneration biofuel 
biodiesel be the most common biofuel in europe it be produce from oil or fat use transesterification and be a liquid similar in composition to fossilmineral diesel chemically it consist mostly of fatty acid methyl or ethyl ester fame feedstock for biodiesel include animal fat vegetable oil soy rapeseed jatropha mahua mustard flax sunflower palm oil hemp field pennycres pongamium pinnatum and alga pure biodiesel b100 also know a neat biodiesel currently reduce emission with up to 60 compare to diesel 
biodiesel can be use in any diesel engine and modify equipment when mix with mineral diesel it can also be use in it pure form b100 in diesel engine but some maintenance and performance problem may then occur during wintertime utilization since the fuel become somewhat more viscou at low temperature depend on the feedstock use 
in many european country a 5 biodiesel blend be widely use and be available at thousand of ga station biodiesel be also an oxygenate fuel mean it contain a reduce amount of carbon and high hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel thi improve the combustion of biodiesel and reduce the particulate emission from unburnt carbon however use pure biodiesel may increase noxemission 
biodiesel be also safe to handle and transport because it be nontoxic and biodegradable and ha a high flash point of about 148c compare to petroleum diesel fuel which ha a flash point of 52c 
in france biodiesel be incorporate at a rate of 8 in the fuel use by all french diesel vehicle avril group produce under the brand diester a fifth of 11 million ton of biodiesel consume annually by the european union it be the lead european producer of biodiesel 
green diesel 
green diesel be produce through hydrocracking biological oil feedstock such a vegetable oil and animal fat hydrocracking be a refinery method that use elevate temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down large molecule such a those find in vegetable oil into short hydrocarbon chain use in diesel engine it may also be call renewable diesel hydrotreated vegetable oil hvo fuel or hydrogenderived renewable diesel unlike biodiesel green diesel ha exactly the same chemical property a petroleumbased diesel it do not require new engine pipeline or infrastructure to distribute and use but ha not be produce at a cost that be competitive with petroleum 
straight vegetable oil 
straight unmodified edible vegetable oil be generally not use a fuel but lowerquality oil ha be use for thi purpose use vegetable oil be increasingly be process into biodiesel or more rarely clean of water and particulate and then use a a fuel the iea estimate that biodiesel production use 17 of global vegetable oil supply in 2021 
an aviation biofuel also know a biojet fuel or bioaviation fuel baf be a biofuel use to power aircraft and be say to be a sustainable aviation fuel saf the international air transport association iatum consider it a key element to reduce the carbon footprint within the environmental impact of aviation aviation biofuel could help decarbonize medium and longhaul air travel generate most emission and could extend the life of old aircraft type by lower their carbon footprint the jargon synthetic paraffinic kerosene spk refer to any nonpetroleumbased fuel design to replace kerosene jet fuel which be often but not alway make from biomas 
aviation biofuel can be produce from plant or animal source such a jatropha alga tallow waste oil palm oil babassu and camelina biospk from solid biomas use pyrolysi process with a fischertropsch proces ftspk with an alcoholtojet atj proces from waste fermentation or from synthetic biology through a solar reactor small piston engine can be modify to burn ethanol 
sustainable biofuel do not compete with food crop prime agricultural land natural forest or fresh water sustainable aviation fuel be certify a be sustainable by a thirdparty organization 
b gaseou biofuel 
bioga and biomethane 
other biofuel include methane ga and biogaswhich can be derive from the fermentation of biomas in the absence of oxygenand methanol butanol and dimethyl etherwhich be in development 
bioga be a mixture compose primarily of methane and carbon dioxide produce by the proces of anaerobic digestion of organic material by microorganism other trace component of thi mixture include water vapor hydrogen sulfide siloxane hydrocarbon ammonium oxygen carbon monoxide and nitrogen it can be produce either from biodegradable waste material or by the use of energy crop feed into anaerobic digester to supplement ga yield the solid byproduct digestate can be use a a biofuel or a fertilizer when co2 and other impurity be remove from bioga it be call biomethane 
bioga can be recover from mechanical biological treatment waste process system landfill ga a le clean form of bioga be produce in landfill through naturally occur anaerobic digestion if it escape into the atmosphere it act a a greenhouse ga 
farmer can produce bioga from manure from their cattle by use anaerobic digester 
synga 
synga a mixture of carbon monoxide hydrogen and variou hydrocarbon be produce by partial combustion of biomas that be combustion with an amount of oxygen that be not sufficient to convert the biomas completely to carbon dioxide and water before partial combustion the biomas be dry and sometime pyrolyzed the result ga mixture synga be more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel more of the energy contain in the fuel be extract 
synga may be burn directly in internal combustion engine turbine or hightemperature fuel cell the wood ga generator a woodfueled gasification reactor can be connect to an internal combustion engine 
synga can be use to produce methanol dimethyl ether and hydrogen or convert vium the fischertropsch proces to produce a diesel substitute or a mixture of alcohol that can be blend into gasoline gasification normally rely on temperature great than 700c 
lowertemperature gasification be desirable when coproducing biochar but result in synga pollute with tar

ius green hydrogen 
first of all it be useful to explain what it be the production of green hydrogen green hydrogen gh2 or gh2 be hydrogen produce by the electrolysi of water use electricity generate from renewable source hydrogen can be utilize a a safe and reliable fuel but it must be produce from a primary source of energy it be consider desirable because when you burn it hydrogen produce water a a byproduct no greenhouse ga ghg emission or air pollutant be associate with the use of hydrogen hydrogen ha the high energy density amongst today most commonly use fuel which include natural ga gasoline and diesel hydrogen be much light than gasoline vapor and air so it dissipate quickly when it be release thi enable quick dispersion in the event of a leak since at room temperature hydrogen ha a very low density hydrogen energy be typically measure by weight in kilogram instead of by volume despite be a colorles ga hydrogen ha be assign color code that be use by the energy industry to indicate the energy source production process and primary feedstock use to produce hydrogen 
the follow scheme can introduce the difference between grey blue and green hydrogen

fig 34 breakdown of hydrogen production technology use variou source today and prediction for the year 2050 international energy agency technical report 2013 
a one can see at the worldwide level the prediction regard hydrogen production technology in 2050 be not optimistic h2 by electrolysi or from biomas can represent not more than 30 and the level of green hydrogen from water hydrolysi be not evaluate 
hydrogen be a clean energy carrier concurrently decarbonize the commercial residential industrial and transportation sector although at present hydrogen be be consider a the main alternative to and replacement for fossil fuel it be not a naturally occur substance instead it be find in chemical substance such a hydrocarbon and water that must undergo chemical transformation to produce hydrogen ga the most widely utilize technique for largescale hydrogen generation be the steam reform of natural ga produce hydrogen by steam reform natural ga involf the utilization of fossil fuel at the production stage where greenhouse gase be emit 
in order to speed up the transition to net zero hydrogen must be obtain from a proces like water electrolysi green hydrogen which do not involve use fossil fuel in spite of the fact that many industry in eu and all over the world have already implement hydrogen fuel system in it infancy the production storage transportation and utilization of hydrogen present issue that need to be address 
hydrogen economy synonymou with sustainable energy refer to the situation where the whole energy system of a country be solely base on hydrogen it can also be define a an economy in which hydrogen be the primary energy carrier along with electricity the realization and development of hydrogenbased economy have be difficult and challenge task due to the substantial investment need hydrogen ha alway have the potential to be significant but the challenge of establish hydrogen economy all over the world have hinder progress thi be mainly because the production storage transportation distribution and utilization sector in the hydrogen economy all have challenge that need to be address while maintain strategic policy support 
hydrogen preparation water electrolysi split 
water split seem to be the most viable proces for large scale hydrogen production from nonfossil natural resource at the moment for the water split proces solar radiation be first convert to electricity in a photovoltaic cell after which the water electrolysi take place in a different cell water electrolysi be achieve use an electrolyzer device the most commonly use electrolyzer device be the alkaline electrolyzer thi type of electrolyzer ha a relatively low capital cost compare to the other type of electrolyzer 
an alkaline electrolyzer use a cell with an anode cathode and an electrolyte base on a solution of caustic salt energy be need to break water molecule into oxygen and hydrogen but thi energy be eventually recover during the oxidation proces to produce water the energy need to split the water to release hydrogen must be obtain from a nonfossil source such a holeelectron pair excitement in a robust semiconductor by solar radiation a sturdy semiconductor material that can satisfy and withstand nature compete requirement be to be use 
exist challenge for water electrolysi presently include low conversion efficiency high electric power cost and high production cost the way of alleviate water electrolysi cost be by reduce the cost of electricity reduce the cost of the electrolyte or remove the membrane separator to reduce ohmic loss for the reduction of the cost of electricity intermittent electricity generate from renewable source such a hydropower and wind can be use nuclear energy offer more costeffective electrolysi and thermolysi compare to other energy source 
hydrogen can also be produce from biomas which be a more environmentally friendly method than generate hydrogen from fossil fuel largescale hydrogen generation from biomas involf the steam reform of biooil steam gasification pyrolysi gasification and the decomposition of sugar use enzyme there be numerou benefit to microbial hydrogen production but since thi technology be still in the lab it cannot be quickly and widely use the main concern for the ma production of hydrogen from biomas be determine if the site be use for produce hydrogen from biomas compete with the feedstock while also address the political aspect of thi decision 
hydrogen storage 
once hydrogen be produce it must be store depend on it intend use hydrogen can be store in the liquid state eg cryogenic liquid dewar the solid state eg metal hydride or the gaseou state eg compress hydrogen ga be store in highpressure ga tank 
use high pressure storage tank for store compress hydrogen be the conventional approach for the storage of hydrogen ga geological storage such a deplete oil and ga reservoir salt cavern and aquifer be currently be consider a the most the most costeffective and viable option for store large amount of gaseou hydrogen 
the approach for store liquid hydrogen can be do use the liquefaction technique the method of hydrogen liquefaction comprise of compression expansion and cool to convert hydrogen ga to liquid hydrogen a dewartype vessel will then be utilize to keep liquid hydrogen at a final temperature of 25315 0c because a significant portion of the hydrogen energy content may be lose during liquefaction store hydrogen in liquid form entail high energy expense 
store hydrogen in the solid form can be do by chemically bond it to alloy in the form of metal hydride metallic alloy that absorb hydrogen be refer to a metal hydride alloy can be use a a storage mechanism due to their ability to absorb and release hydrogen these metal hydride can be categorize into three main group tibased alloy mgbased alloy and lani5based alloy to resist the chargedischarge cycle these metal hydride alloy must be thermally and structurally stable implement metal hydride storage system present two key challenge a delay between initial heat and the release of the hydrogen ga and insufficient heat to generate hydrogen from the hydride 
choose the state or form for store hydrogen strongly depend on the enduse energy conversion application with each storage option have it own pro and con hydrogen be store in the solid state on the other hand be consider more efficient and safe than liquefaction and compression due to low selfdischarge leak proof statu and high charge efficiency con 
transportation and distribution of hydrogen 
highstrength steel pipeline link the storage and production point to the enduse point make up the infrastructure for transport and distribute hydrogen pipeline material constantly in contact with hydrogen easily get embrittle by hydrogen thi mechanism be refer to a hydrogen embrittlement and can damage a wide range of material even the highstrength steel pipeline currently be use for transport and distribute hydrogen in hydrogen embrittlement lone hydrogen atom first diffuse through the metal small quantity of hydrogen diffuse into the metal at high temperature while diffusion be aid by a concentration gradient at low temperature while recombine in minuscule void of the metal to form hydrogen molecule hydrogen atom create pressure in the cavity they be trap in the pressure will buildup and eventually cause the metal to crack open by adhere to the recommend maintenance procedure and safety measure unwanted loss and damage can be easily avoid other transportation and distribution system component include pressure reduction station pipe seal and enduse component must also be evaluate for suitability 
accord to a study conduct by the eu natural ga can be blend with about 30 hydrogen without put the general public safety in jeopardy 
future hydrogen transportation and distribution system may resemble the natural ga pipeline that be currently in use but with new modification like good duct material to prevent hydrogen leakage alternative work pressure and high flow rate to overcome gaseou hydrogen low energy content it be envisage in the hydrogen economy that from the production plant and storage unit liquid hydrogen will be transport and distribute to consumer by mean of supertanker while gaseou hydrogen will be transport and distribute through underground pipeline 
hydrogen use 
in addition to hydrogen usage in the chemical and oil and ga sector it can also be utilize in transportation application such a internal combustion engine ice and fuel cell hydrogen fuel cell have enormou potential in the transportation sector to improve the energy efficiency significantly reduce greenhouse ga emission and ultimately eradicate the utilization of fossil fuel not only can fuel cell be use in truck bus and car but they can also be use to power electric ship and replace diesel electric generator in locomotive hydrogen fuel cell be see a the most promise power source for next generation automobile in the hydrogen economy and the only technology that ha a chance of rival internal combustion engine ice hydrogen primary sell point a a fuel be it intrinsic suitability for usage in fuel cell a fuel cell vehicle power by pure hydrogen be consider an emissionfree vehicle because the only byproduct be water while maintain comparable characteristic in term of peak speed range and acceleration fuel cell vehicle be consider way more efficient than conventional vehicle 
advancement in the hydrogenpowered vehicle technology be marketdriven and must compete with the conventional vehicle presently the lack of refuel infrastructure the low cost of gasoline and the rise in vehicle cost be all impede the advancement of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle another major concern be how to provide hydrogen to fuel cell the option available be to either use the vehicle fuel processor to produce hydrogen or store hydrogen on board of the vehicle 
hydrogen ha a wide range of benefit hydrogen play a significant role in decarbonize global energy sector by present carbonfree fuel flexibility and also provide energy storage to the grid hydrogen versatility a a clean fuel ability to power system service and provide heat can be exploit to reduce the carbon intensity of multiple economic sector the deployment of hydrogen technology could neutralize up to about onefourth of global greenhouse ga emission produce by industry and fossil fuel by the year 2030 thousand of green job will also be generate a global hydrogen economy develop the skill apply in the fossil fuel industry today be applicable to the green hydrogen industry also the utilization of hydrogen a an alternative option to diesel and gasoline for transport will reduce price shock that usually occur in the global fossil fuel supply chain thi be mainly because hydrogen can be produce from variou renewable source so ultimately it price will stabilize in the long run 
for the many benefit hydrogen provide there be still a few con and challenge that need to be address despite hydrogen be the most abundant element on earth it do not exist on it own and need to be extract from either water use the water electrolysi technique or fossil fuel both of which demand a substantial amount of energy to be achieve give how highly flammable hydrogen be a a fuel there be legitimate safety concern about it widespread utilization 
base on the goal of hydrogen economy the benefit of hydrogen far outweigh the con hydrogen ha a great potential to become the ideal solution for the future of my energy requirement but thi will require massive investment and political decision 
hydrogen offer a major potential to solve the energy landscape big challenge which be to decarbonize heat ongoing research show that hydrogen be the lead choice for decarbonize heat without jeopardize the safety of the general public 
an openminded vision for the time be but optimistic and really interest for the future be to link preparation of hydrogen by circular economy bioeconomy technology with use of thi ga a renewable fuel in a decarbonate system create the already define hydrogen economy a it be represent in the follow presentation link water industry wi and circular economy cre perspective be crucial to green hydrogen production hp 
thu it be essential to manage the water and wastewater resource follow reduce reuse recycle reclaim recover and restore 6r strategy of cre establish a crebased selfenergygenerating wi can be a plausible solution for the future energy crisi and sustainable resource management

there be still numerou obstacle and limitation that currently limit the potential of hydrogen a a fuel source to serve a a significant alternative to ff now such a largescale hydrogen production cost infrastructure investment bulk storage transport and distribution safety consideration the absence of an exist value chain and the requirement for international standard and so on 
consider the environmental pollution global warm issue and future energy security a twofold revolutionary energy transition be immediately necessary the early movement can be the energy revolution the steady and intensive transition from ffbased primary energy to sustainable and renewable energy source such a solar wind geothermal biomas and water the subsequent phase would be the development of a sustainable hydrogen economy base on the extensive usage of hydrogen a a green secondary energy carrier 
1 the cre do not concentrate on wi at a largescale also the application scope opportunity limitation and challenge of cre implementation in water industry be still unexplored thu identification and the potential implication of cre in wi be essential for sustainable water resource management and resource recovery 
2 compare with the overall production method the most environmentally friendly hp offer photonic energy and the high efficiency offer thermal energy 
3 consider fee source pem proton exchange membrane electrolyze be the most suitable technology for hp in pure water wherea mec microbial electrolysi cell be the most appropriate technology for hp in wastewater if we consider seawater a a fee source ed electrodialysi and red reverse electrodialysi be the most competitive technology for simultaneou desalination and hp although all these hp technology be in their r d stage 
4 an analysi by the iea find that the hp cost for green hydrogen 255kg blue hydrogen 150350kg and grey hydrogen be all roughly 150kg yue et al 2021 the cost of hp 
technology like el electrolysi red and pecm photoelectrochemical method must be reduce to make hydrogen a viable fuel source for everyone 
5 case study analysi in hp technology and wi suggest european country be the dominant hydrogen producer have 6269 of active project germany have the high number of active hydrogen production case study record to be 50 
6 the major challenge for develop a hydrogen economy be scale up hp and the transition from carbonintensive to low carbon hp cost for green hp be still too high to be competitive with other energy source economically the hydrogen price per kg should be approximately 15 for hp to be profitable the need for ultrapure water pose one of the big obstacle since it take 9 l of water to produce 1 kg of hydrogen ga which could trigger a water shortage in the future hydrogen economy he 
the future perspective and research direction of green hydrogen production in wi for cre framework be recommend a follow 
establishment of a crebased self hydrogen energygenerating wi can be a plausible solution for the future energy crisi and sustainable resource management since one of the significant requirement of water electrolysi be the need for highly pure water fee before far proceed to develop a he by 2030 the feasibility study of pure water requirement be highly recommend 
it wa estimate that 21 billion m3 of pure fresh water would be require to meet the ambitiou demand for he by 2030 
accessible freshwater make up just 1 of the planet water it be best to avoid burden freshwater usage especially in area where drink water be difficult to attain almost all the remain 99 or about 14 billion km3 be seawater which can be purify through desalination process before be use a an electrolysi feedstock by electrodialysi or reverse osmosi technique 
special consideration should be focus on wastewater to hydrogen production because it wa estimate that 359 billion m3 of wastewater be produce each year and 785 million person lack acces to clean drink water simultaneou ww treatment resource recovery nitrogen potassium and phosphoru and hydrogen production could be a feasible option to clean green hydrogen production for a good he without burden the fresh water 
green hydrogen cost could be one of the most significant obstacle to proceed with the he hence measure should be take to maintain the hydrogen cost within 115 kg hydrogen to compete with the alternative ffsbased energy 
research on develop costeffective catalyst and inexpensive membrane material for pem electrolysi for hp be need from pw pure water wherea mec need simple cell design high membrane stability and minimal operational cost 
hydrogen storage and safety issue also be need to consider 
research and development should be focus on development of lowcost hydrogen storage material in order to minimize possible hazard and risk of hydrogen health and environmental safety guideline should be follow strictly 
international standard and regulation on the growth of worldwide h2 market and development of a proper hydrogen supply chain system would be necessary for the future he
