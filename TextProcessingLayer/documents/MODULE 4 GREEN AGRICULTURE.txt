module iv green sustainable agriculture 

eu target 
ensure food security in the face of geopolitical uncertainty climate change and biodiversity los 
reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the eu food system 
strengthen the eu food system resilience 
lead a global transition toward competitive sustainability from farm to fork 
intensive conventional agriculture contribute to climate change water pollution los of biodiversity or naturalresource depletion a well a be directly affect by it even though such concern be broadly acknowledge we continue to uphold excessive and unsustainable production or consumption habit that be responsible for exceed my planet boundary or reach irreversible tip point due to my population growth rate we must simultaneously focu on feed humanity while not deplete natural resource 
thi be why the future be the application of green sustainable agriculture which can be define a desire type of agricultural activity to supply society food and textile need in the present without compromise the ability of future generation to meet their own need so it be to develop a healthy food system for person and planet and it be a type of agriculture that be the opposite of intensive agriculture 
sustainable agriculture aim to reduce co2 emission avoid soil degradation from pesticide and fertilizer conserve water and increase biodiversity however achieve thi goal require consider variou social and economic factor one crucial aspect be the integration of innovative technology that could either help to transition to sustainable agriculture or worsen the environmental impact of industrial agriculture in essence sustainable agriculture aim to produce food without harm the environment while ensure fair condition for farmer and worker 
sustainable agriculture aim to tackle the two main challenge face humanity result from conventional farm practice environmental degradation and climate change the link between healthy person healthy society and a healthy planet put sustainable food system at the heart of the european green deal the eu sustainable and inclusive growth strategy it be design to boost the economy improve people health and quality of life and care for nature 
i capcommon agriculture policy 
eu cap be central to the eu green deal it farm to fork and biodiversity strategy 
the european agriculture and food system support by the common agricultural policy be already a global standard in term of safety security of supply nutrition and quality now it must also become the global standard for sustainability a shift to a sustainable food system while ensure food affordability and availability bring environmental health and social benefit a well a offer fair economic gain 
that be why in july 2023 the commission adopt a package of measure for a sustainable use of key natural resource which will also strengthen the resilience of european food system and farm the package include a new soil law which will help u have healthy soil in the eu by 2050 a regulation on plant produce by genome technique and measure to reduce food and textile waste it adoption complete the previou proposal under the natural resource pillar of the european green deal 
today the cap support a modern marketoriented farm sector provide safe affordable highquality food produce sustainably and respect consumer standard environmental animal welfare food safety etc a well a support investment in the broad rural economy the cap be a common policy for all eu country manage and fund at european level from the eu budget 
income support through direct payment that help protect income stability for farmer who comply with environmental and social requirement 
market measure to help the agrifood sector deal with difficult market situation 
rural development intervention address specific need and challenge face rural europe

the common agricultural policy cap be build around three main goal to achieve a sustainable system of agriculture in the eu economic sustainability environmental sustainability and the social sustainability of farm 
main objective 
1 ensure viable farm income 
support viable farm income and the resilience of the agricultural sector acros the eu in order to enhance longterm food security and agricultural diversity a well a to ensure the economic sustainability of agricultural production 

fig 2 cap specific objective 
2 increase competitivenes the role of productivity 
enhance market orientation and increase farm competitivenes both in the short and long term include great focu on research technology and digitalization 
3 farmer position in value chain 
provide measure that aim to strengthen farmer position in a continuously evolve value chain increase market transparency and ensure effective mechanism against unfair trade practice 
4 agriculture and climate mitigation 
contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation include by reduce greenhouse ga emission and enhance carbon sequestration a well a promote sustainable energy 
5 efficient soil management 
foster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resource such a water soil and air include by reduce chemical dependency 
6 biodiversity and farm landscape 
contribute to halt and reverse biodiversity los enhance ecosystem service and preserve habitat and landscape 
7 structural change and generational renewal 
attract and sustain young farmer and new farmer and facilitate sustainable busines development in rural area 
8 job and growth in rural area 
promote employment growth gender equality include the participation of woman in farm social inclusion and local development in rural area a well a the circular bioeconomy and sustainable forestry 
9 health food antimicrobial resistance 
improve the response of eu agriculture to societal demand relate to food and health include highquality safe and nutritiou food produce in a sustainable way to reduce food waste a well a to improve animal welfare and combat antimicrobial resistance 
10 drive simplification 
modernize agriculture and rural area by foster and share knowledge innovation and digitalization and by encourage their uptake by farmer through improve acces to research innovation knowledge exchange and train 
improvement to exist requirement will also far increase sustainability for example 
a to improve longterm soil health in principle farmer will be require to carry out beneficial crop rotation crop diversification the current obligation will be permit a an alternative although it do not have the same benefit for soil health a crop rotation with exemption take into account the obligation of crop rotation or diversification will apply to an estimate 86 of the eu arable land 
b farmer will also increase their contribution to biodiversity by in principle devote at least 4 of their arable land to nonproductive feature and area include fallow land the obligatory minimum for such nonproductive feature will be 3 where farmer top up that total to 7 through an ecoscheme or where farmer devote significant additional land to catch crop or nitrogenfixing crop cultivate without plant protection product or fertilizer in each case 
compatibility with the green deal 
a a first step the nine common objective cover economic social and environmental dimension in line with the green deal ambition they aim to increase the contribution of eu agriculture to climate change action improve the management of natural resource ensure a fair economic return for farmer and reinforce the protection of biodiversity among other 
the new way of work propose for the future cap be one of the key element that make the proposal compatible with the green deal base on a thorough assessment of the local condition and need member state will produce a national cap strategic plan that will explain how they will use cap tool to achieve the nine objective in consultation with stakeholder and competent national authority in addition to ensure that these plan be coherent and consistent with the require environmental ambition the commission will approve each cap strategic plan ahead of their implementation finally quantify target will allow the commission to monitor the progress make by member state when implement the cap 
in addition the cap proposal include tool that will far promote sustainable farm practice throughout the eu crucial to achieve the green deal ambition 
among those the future cap include conditionality which link area and animalbased cap payment to a range of obligation in addition it also introduce the new ecoscheme that aim to reward farmer for go far in the implementation of sustainable agricultural practice these practice could include the implementation of environmentally friendly production system such a agroecology agroforestry and organic farm the rural development framework also include environmental and climate management commitment which aim to compensate farmer and other beneficiary for voluntarily commit themself to implement sustainable practice 
furthermore other tool under rural development can support the transition for example fund can be use to invest in green infrastructure in knowledge transfer and innovation or in develop acces to fast broadband in rural area on top of thi the cap proposal include that a minimum of 30 of rural development fund should go toward cap intervention that addres specific environmental and climaterelated objective 
furthermore the cap proposal also include objective on rebalancing power in the food supply chain a well a contribute to new societal demand relate to food and health include safe nutritiou and sustainable food food waste and animal welfare in practical term thi mean that member state be require to review their action in these area and propose how to use different cap tool to addres challenge identify for instance the commission will continue to support cooperation between producer through producer organization these type of organization allow producer to strengthen their position in the supply chain increase their resilience and act collectively to enhance sustainability of the supply chain these objective be also reflect in the green deal ambition they will be essential to enable the transition while leave no one behind 
adapt and apply research on the grind the european innovation partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability eipagrus will continue to help translate research result into innovation on the grind with support from cap tool finance relate investment cooperation and knowledge exchange and innovation support service 
the common agricultural policy cap 202327 enter into force on 1 january 2023 thi mark the begin of the implementation of the 28 approve cap strategic plan in 27 eu country eu member have one strategic plan each except belgium which ha one for flander and one for wallonium 
a total of 3866 billion be available for the cap from the eu budget 20212027 thi be divide between two fund often refer to a the two pillar of the cap these be 
the european agricultural guarantee fund eagf know a pillar 1 which provide 2911 billion of direct financial support to farmer 
the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd know a pillar 2 which provide 955 billion include 81 billion from the next generation eu recovery instrument for socioeconomic and environmental intervention 
in november 2023 the european commission publish an assessment of cap strategic plan csp delivery on cap objective the report rely on the information contain in the cap national plan a well a on qualitative appraisal of the potential effect of the choice make by eu country thi preliminary assessment summarize the combine contribution of the intervention plan by eu country to addres the cap specific objective and the six euwide green deal target on 
fair income for farmer and keep rural area vibrant 
environment and climate action 
social sustainability and societal expectation such a animal welfare 


fig 3 eu budget distribution for cap for the period 20232027 
direction of action 
a a strong position for farmer in the marketplace 
improve rule on competition limit exemption from competition law will be expand in a welltargeted manner allow farmer to work together to strengthen their position in the food supply chain thi include derogation for agreement set high sustainability standard a well a possibility for supply regulation for foodstuff with protect geographical name 
b social conditionality link support to respect of right of farm worker the new cap step up the support for generational renewal and participation of woman in the farm sector 
c improve the knowledge base by allow transfer of cap fund to the eu erasmu program the cap offer member state an opportunity to enhance the transnational learningrelated mobility of young farmer and of woman from rural area 
d comprehensive and strategic approach each member state will have to set out in it cap plan csp it strategy for stimulate innovation and modernization thi strategy should refer among other thing to 
the overall organization of the member state agricultural knowledge and innovation system aki 
the way in which cap network advisory service and research will cooperate in the context of aki 
a strategic approach toward the digitalization of farm and rural area eur 9 billion for research and innovation in the area of food bioeconomy natural resource agriculture and environment be part of the horizon europe program 20212027 
e at the same time the high level of resource allocate to the complementary redistributive income support for sustainability cris reinforce income support that go directly to small and mediumsized farm 
f there be a pattern acros the eu to supplement income support for farm in area with natural and other constraint anc by compensate high cost of produce food and fee in area affect by poor climate soil or other condition such a mountain or land in dry or cold territory thi support help maintain agricultural activity in such area and positively influence socioeconomic factor 
g overall 35 of the eu farmland should benefit from landbased voluntary action for both carbon sequestration and reduction of n2o emission 
h csp support for extensive livestock system help to maintain not only carbon stock but also traditional landscape while improve fee autonomy and economic activity on marginal land many csp recognize explicitly the need to reduce livestockrelated emission notably methane from ruminant in particular csp include support for investment in improve manure storage and management equipment for lowemission slurry spread and anaerobic digester thi will be supplement by support for genetic improvement 
i the potential to increase sustainable energy production through the csp come mainly from support for the use of agrophotovoltaic and investment in biomethane production 
j approach to adapt to the decrease of available water and ensure longterm resilience through naturebased solution water retention in the landscape le waterintensive crop water reuse will have to be reinforce and good integrate with longterm strategic plan by 2027 an estimate 10 of the eu agricultural area should receive csp support for organic farm 
k the csp contribute to increase the presence of high diversity landscape feature toward the biodiversity strategy target of 10 of agricultural land by 2030 the strengthen obligation to dedicate at least 4 of arable land to nonproductive element be a significant change for those member state and farmer who rely on productive area nitrogenfixing crop and catch crop to comply with green 
l all csp demonstrate some contribution toward the target stem from the eu habitat and bird directive area of eu grassland protect against conversion and plough have expand by 9 and voluntary measure for improve management aim to cover 25 of natura 2000 area 

about the sustainable use of pesticide 
over the past 10 year the eu agricultural sector make significant step toward a more sustainable future without impact it capacity to supply quality food 
in 2019 pesticide sale decline by almost 30 000 ton 7 compare to 2011 
greenhouse ga emission have be around 435 million ton of co2equivalent a 25 decrease compare to 1990 
the area under organic production reach 138 million ha in 2019 follow an annual increase of 55 over the period 20122019 
over the last ten year the eu organic food and drink market double it size worth around 41 billion in 2019 
the gros valueadded of the eu agricultural production reach 224 billion euro in 2019 a 19 increase compare to 2010 
the eu agrifood product trade balance record an annual growth of almost 10 in average between 2010 and 2020 reach 62 billion euro of net trade in 2020 
in the meantime climate change and biodiversity los be already impact eu agriculture 
50 of land in the eu cultivate with crop dependent on pollinator face a pollination deficit 
drought be cost an average of 9 billion euro a year in economic damage to agriculture energy and public water supply 
antimicrobial resistance link to excessive and inappropriate use in animal and human healthcare lead to an estimate 33000 human death a year 
global mean crop yield of rice maize and wheat be project to decrease 3 to 10 per degree of warm 
so it wa the moment to reinforce the regulation on pesticide use the european commission ha adopt a proposal for a new regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection product include eu wide target to reduce by 50 the use and risk of chemical pesticide by 2030 in line with the eu farm to fork and biodiversity strategy 
the proposal adopt on 22 june 2022 be part of a package of measure to reduce the environmental footprint of the eu food system and help mitigate the economic loss that we be already suffer due to climate change and biodiversity los the main measure include 
legally bind target at eu level to reduce by 50 the use and the risk of chemical pesticide a well a the use of the more hazardou pesticide by 2030 member state will set their own national reduction target within define parameter to ensure that the eu wide target be achieve 
environmentally friendly pest control new measure will ensure that all farmer and other professional pesticide user practice integrate pest management ipm thi be an environmentally friendly system of pest control which focuse on pest prevention and prioritize alternative pest control method with chemical pesticide only use a a last resort 
a ban on all pesticide in sensitive area the use of all pesticide be prohibit in place such a urban green area include public park or garden playground recreation or sport grind public path a well a protect area in accordance with natura 2000 and any ecologically sensitive area to be preserve for threaten pollinator 

ius farm to fork strategy 
the farm to fork strategy be at the heart of the green deal thi strategy aim to reward those farmer fisher and other operator in the food chain who have already undergo the transition to sustainable practice enable the transition for the other and create additional opportunity for their business a such even though the eu transition to sustainable food system ha start in many area food system remain one of the key driver of climate change and environmental degradation there be an urgent need to reduce dependency on pesticide and antimicrobial reduce exces fertilization increase organic farm improve animal welfare and reverse biodiversity los 
overall european diet be not in line with national dietary recommendation and the food environment do not ensure that the healthy option be alway the easy one if european diet be in line with dietary recommendation the environmental footprint of food system would be significantly reduce 
at the same time effort to tighten sustainability requirement in the eu food system should be accompany by policy that help raise standard globally in order to avoid the externalization and export of unsustainable practice 
the eu goal be to reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the eu food system and strengthen it resilience ensure food security in the face of climate change and biodiversity los and lead a global transition toward competitive sustainability from farm to fork and tap into new opportunity thi mean 

1 ensure that the food chain cover food production transport distribution market and consumption ha a neutral or positive environmental impact preserve and restore the land freshwater and seabased resource on which the food system depend help to mitigate climate change and adapt to it impact protect land soil water air plant and animal health and welfare and reverse the los of biodiversity 
2 ensure food security nutrition and public health make sure that everyone ha acces to sufficient nutritiou sustainable food that uphold high standard of safety and quality plant health and animal health and welfare while meet dietary need and food preference 
3 preserve the affordability of food while generate fair economic return in the supply chain so that ultimately the most sustainable food also become the most affordable foster the competitivenes of the eu supply sector promote fair trade create new busines opportunity while ensure integrity of the single market and occupational health and safety 
technical and financial assistance from exist eu instrument such a cohesion fund and the european agricultural fund for rural development eafrd will support the transition 
combine with certification and label on the sustainability performance of food product and with target incentive the framework will allow operator to benefit from sustainable practice and progressively raise sustainability standard so a to become the norm for all food product place on the eu market 
main action 
1 ensure sustainable food production 
a a announce in the circular economy action plan ceap the commission will develop a regulatory framework for certify co2 removal from the atmosphere base on robust and transparent carbon account to monitor and verify the authenticity of carbon removal 
b the circular biobased economy be still a largely untapped potential for farmer and their cooperative for example advance biorefinery that produce biofertilizer protein fee bioenergy and biochemical offer opportunity for the transition to a climateneutral european economy and the creation of new job in primary production 
c farmer should grasp opportunity to reduce methane emission from livestock by develop the production of renewable energy and invest in anaerobic digester for bioga production from agriculture waste and residue such a manure farm also have the potential to produce bioga from other source of waste and residue such a from the food and beverage industry sewage wastewater and municipal waste 
d farm house and barn be often perfect for place solar panel and such investment should be prioritize in the future cap strategic plan 
e the commission will take additional action to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical pesticide by 50 and the use of more hazardou pesticide by 50 by 2030 to pave the way to alternative and maintain farmer income the commission will take a number of step it will revise the sustainable use of pesticide directive enhance provision on integrate pest management ipm and promote great use of safe alternative way of protect harvest from pest and disease ipm will encourage the use of alternative control technique such a crop rotation and mechanical weed and will be one of the main tool in reduce the use of and dependency on chemical pesticide in general and the use of more hazardou pesticide in particular the commission will also facilitate the place on the market of pesticide contain biological active substance 
f the commission will develop with member state an integrate nutrient management action plan to addres nutrient pollution at source and increase the sustainability of the livestock sector the commission will also work with member state to extend the application of precise fertilization technique and sustainable agricultural practice of recycle of organic waste into renewable fertilizer cap strategic plan such a the farm sustainability tool for nutrient management 
g to help reduce the environmental and climate impact of animal production avoid carbon leakage through import and to support the ongoing transition toward more sustainable livestock farm the commission will facilitate the place on the market of sustainable and innovative fee additive 
h the commission will therefore take action to reduce overall eu sale of antimicrobial for farm animal and in aquaculture by 50 by2030 
i the commission be carry out a study which will look at the potential of new genomic technique to improve sustainability along the food supply chain sustainable food system also rely on seed security and diversity farmer need to have acces to a range of quality seed for plant variety adapt to the pressure of climate change the commission will take measure to facilitate the registration of seed variety include for organic farm and to ensure easy market acces for traditional and locallyadapted variety 
j the commission will put forward an action plan on organic farm thi will help member state stimulate both supply and demand for organic product it will ensure consumer trust and boost demand through promotion campaign and green public procurement thi approach will help to reach the objective of at least 25 of the eu agricultural land under organic farm by 2030 and a significant increase in organic aquaculture 
k the new ecoscheme will offer a major stream of fund to boost sustainable practice such a precision agriculture agroecology include organic farm carbon farm and agroforestry 
l in parallel to change in agriculture the shift to sustainable fish and seafood production must also be accelerate 
m farm fish and seafood generate a low carbon footprint than animal production on land in addition it will be a significant support by the next european maritime and fishery fund for sustainable seafood farm 

2 ensure food security 
a the commission will step up it coordination of a common european response to crisis affect food system in order to ensure food security and safety reinforce public health and mitigate their socioeconomic impact in the eu 
b draw on the lesson learn the commission will ass the resilience of the food system and develop a contingency plan for ensure food supply and food security to be put in place in time of crisi 
c for stimulate sustainable food process wholesale retail hospitality and food service practice the commission will develop an eu code of conduct for responsible busines and market practice accompany with a monitor framework 
d the deployment of a circular and sustainable eu bioeconomy will provide busines opportunity for instance link to make use of food waste 
e food package play a key role in the sustainability of food system the commission will revise the food contact material legislation to improve food safety and public health in particular in reduce the use of hazardou chemical support the use of innovative and sustainable package solution use environmentallyfriendly reusable and recyclable material and contribute to food waste reduction 
f promote sustainable food consumption and facilitate the shift to healthy sustainable diet it be of great importance so to improve the availability and price of sustainable food and to promote healthy and sustainable diet in institutional cater the commission will determine the best way of set minimum mandatory criterium for sustainable food procurement 
g reduce food los and waste 
h combat food fraud along the food supply chain 
i research and innovation ru be key driver in accelerate the transition to sustainable healthy and inclusive food system from primary production to consumption 
j through it external policy include international cooperation and trade policy the eu will pursue the development of green alliance on sustainable food system with all it partner in bilateral regional and multilateral forum the eu will promote the global transition to sustainable food system in international standard set body relevant multilateral forum and international event 
the commission will ensure that the strategy be implement in close coherence with the other element of the green deal particularly the biodiversity strategy for 2030 the new ceap and the zero pollution ambition 

iius sustainable agriculture procedure 
sustainable agriculture consist of use farm technique that respect the environment biodiversity and the earth natural waste absorption capacity 
there be no single model that define itself a sustainable by nature but there be several that be base on different or even integrate technique and knowledge 

fig 4 benefit of green sustainable agriculture procedure sherya d et al sustainable agriculture a path toward good future food and scientific report vol 1 no 9 2020 2227 

1 permaculture 
the term refer not only to a set of agricultural practice orient toward the natural maintenance of soil fertility but also to a design system that intertwine issue from architecture economic ecology anthropology and legal system the aim be to optimally and ethically design and manage landscape to meet people need in harmony with natural system 
here the emphasi be give on the use of perennial crop like fruit tree nut tree and shrub that all function together in a design system that mimic how plant in a natural ecosystem would function permaculture design technique include herb spiral keyhole and mandala garden hugelkultur garden bed hugelkultur be the proces of make raise garden bed fill with rotten wood the result be a lowmaintenance garden that doesnt require irrigation or fertilization sheet mulch and grow grain without tillage each plant serve multiple purpose and create swale on contmy to hold water high on the landscape 
2 biodynamic farm 
it be an approach of farm system where the farm be treat a a live system and significant emphasi be give on overall development of the farm the interrelationship between component of the farm ie soil plant animal and microbe be also consider biodynamic system be a combination of biological practice which involf ageold organic farm technique that improve soil health and dynamic practice which involve the influence of cosmic force to develop the farm it inhabitant and product it be report some biodynamic preparation with the main ingredient like cow manure silica and extract of different plant part like yarrow flower chamomile flower oak bark sting nettle shoot etc which can either by apply through field spray or by compost 
3 urban agriculture 
it cover a wide range of activity from the cultivation of different type of crop like grain vegetable mushroom and fruit and rear animal such a poultry and fish to the cultivation of nonfood product like aromatic and medicinal herb or ornamental plant it illuminate a different paradigm from the transformation of city from only consumer of food to generator of agricultural product to contribute to sustainability improve health and poverty alleviation it not only use vacant urban area for agriculture production but also help to transform wastewater and organic solid waste into resource for grow agriculture product the former can be use for irrigation the latter a fertilizer another idea be segregate dry and wet waste a well a recycle the kitchen waste to prepare homemade compost which will not only help to cut back city waste dump but also provide each and every household a good pot mix for garden 
4 hydroponic and aquaponic 
these innovative farm technique involve the grow of plant without soil nourish the plant through specialize nutrient that be add to water in the hydroponic system crop be grow with the root directly expose to a mineral solution or with the root in an inert medium like gravel or perlite cucumber lettuce tomato pepper be commonly grow in thi system in aquaponic rise of aquatic animal such a fish be combine with grow of hydroponic crop where water contain the waste material from the aquaculture fish be use to nourish the hydroponic plant both these system have widescale availability from small homescale system to commercialscale system 
5 agroforestry and food forest 
agroforestry be an integrate approach of use the interactive benefit from combine tree and shrub with crop it combine agricultural and forestry technology to create more diverse productive profitable healthy and sustainable landuse system beside become an additional source of income for farmer tree create a favorable microclimate that maintain favorable temperature and soil humidity while protect crop from wind or heavy rain stabilize soil minimize nutrient runoff and improve soil structure food forest be design permaculture system that consist of a multilayered edible forest such a forest be compose almost entirely of perennial food plant include a canopy of tall and dwarf fruit and nut tree a fruit shrub layer layer of perennial herb mushroom and vegetable at the grind level climb plant and root vegetable underground 

fig 5 different model of agroforestry sherya d et al sustainable agriculture a path toward good future food and scientific report vol 1 no 9 2020 2227 

6 polyculture and crop rotation 
in order to tackle pest and weed problem a some pest prefer specific host maintain and enhance the soil quality cope up with weather fluctuation ensure additional income to the farmer and a healthy diet to the community polyculture and crop rotation over monoculture be very scientific and innovative approach here emphasi be give on the fact that crop which be grow together should be complementary to each other 
7 grow heirloom and old variety 
in order to meet market demand for the viability of produce to travel long distance and to be store for long period of time only a few variety be grow commercially thi reduce genetic variability in food crop lead to their inability to adapt to change in climate disease and pest incidence to save the gene pool of indigenou variety preserve the biodiversity of seed establish future climateresistant variety grow of heirloom and old variety and save their seed be very important 
8 natural animal rise 
to protect the crop from animal consumption industrial agriculture keep livestock graze away from the farm simultaneously crop away from manure but there exist a mutually beneficial relationship between graze animal and grassland through manage graze in one hand wide variety of nutrient will be provide to the animal on the other hand excessive foot fall will help to compact the soil thu prevent soil erosion while the manure leave behind will enrich the soil 
9 mulch groundcover and manual weed control 
in order to provide a protective layer to the soil restrict proliferation of weed conserve soil moisture improve soil health fertility and shield soil from direct sunlight mulch and groundcover be a good option mulch can be of both organic and inorganic origin the former consist of straw husk saw dust grass and cover crop manure and compost etc while the late mostly indicate the polyethylene mulch in which the most popular be the black plastic mulch 
10 natural pest management 
in thi method of control pest insect bird animal plant and mechanical practice be use instead of use chemical the farm can be manage in such a way that it can harbor natural predator of agricultural pest use the preypredator relationship the population of harmful pest be keep under control 
organic pesticide be derive from naturally occur source these include live organism such a the bacterium bacillu thuringiensi which be use to control caterpillar pest or plant derivative such a pyrethrin from the dry flower head of chrysanthemum cinerariifolium or neem oil from the seed of azadirachtum indica mineralbased inorganic pesticide such a sulfur and copper be also allow 
in addition to pesticide organic pest control integrate biological cultural and genetic control to minimize pest damage biological control utilize the natural enemy of pest such a predatory insect eg ladybug or parasitoid eg certain wasp to attack insect pest pest cycle can be disrupt with cultural control of which crop rotation be the most widely use finally traditional plant breed ha produce numerou crop variety that be resistant to specific pest the use of such variety and the plant of genetically diverse crop provide genetic control against pest and many plant disease 
these technique be define a component of organic farm mean agriculture in harmony with nature 


iv organic farm in eu 
1 organic farm procedure 
it be a production model that only allow the use of natural substance accord to the european regulation eec 209291 and aim at avoid the massive exploitation of natural resource beside the already mention procedure biological fertilizer be apply and naturalderived biocide certify organic farm do not use synthetic chemical such a fertilizer herbicide fungicide insecticide pesticide but only use natural fertilizer and traditional technique crop rotation 
compare with conventional agriculture organic farm use few pesticide reduce soil erosion decrease nitrate leach into groundwater and surface water and recycle animal waste back into the farm these benefit be counterbalance by high food cost for consumer and generally low yield indeed yield of organic crop have be find to be about 25 percent low overall than conventionally grow crop although thi can vary considerably depend upon the type of crop the challenge for future organic agriculture will be to maintain it environmental benefit increase yield and reduce price while meet the challenge of climate change and an increase world population 
farmer must be certify for their produce and product to be label organic and there be specific organic standard for crop animal and wildcrafted product and for the process of agricultural product organic standard in the european union and the unite state for example prohibit the use of synthetic pesticide fertilizer ionize radiation sewage sludge and genetically engineer plant or product in the eu organic certification and inspection be carry out by approve organic control body accord to eu standard 

fig 6 sustainable agriculture procedure 

2 eu organic farm action plan 
the commission ha set out a comprehensive organic action plan for the european union through it the commission will aim to achieve the european green deal target of 25 of agricultural land under organic farm by 2030 

fig 7 organic farm area in the total eu agriculture surface in 2019 
the action plan be break into three interlink axe that reflect the structure of the food supply chain and the green deal sustainability objective 
axi 1 stimulate demand and ensure consumer trust 
axi 2 stimulate conversion and reinforce the entire value chain 
axi 3 organic lead by example improve the contribution of organic farm to environmental sustainability 
the three axe will be support by 23 action continue some of the successful 201420 action a well a put forward an array of new action and mobilize different source of fund 
focu on research and innovation organic farm be knowledgeintensive however there be still a clear need to far enhance the knowledge so that organic farm can become even more sustainable and also more productive to support the ambition of the action plan the commission intend to dedicate at least 30 of the budget for research and innovation action in the field of agriculture forestry and rural area to topic specific to or relevant for the organic sector thi include issue such a increase crop yield genetic biodiversity and alternative to contentiou product 
axi 1 stimulate demand and ensure consumer trust 
increase the consumption of organic product and strengthen consumer trust in them be vital to encourage farmer to convert to organic to support continue growth and maintain a profitable market for organic operator the commission will undertake action to 
promote organic farm and the eu logo 
promote organic canteen and increase the use of green public procurement 
reinforce organic school scheme 
prevent food fraud and strengthen consumer trust 
improve traceability 
facilitate the contribution of the private sector 
axi 2 stimulate conversion and reinforce the entire value chain 
to continue progress in production and process the action plan will 
encourage conversion investment and exchange of best practice 
develop sector analysi to increase market transparency 
support the organization of the food chain 
reinforce local and smallvalue process and foster short trade circuit 
improve animal nutrition in accordance with organic rule 
reinforce organic aquaculture 
axi 3 organic lead by example improve the contribution of organic farm to sustainability 
the commission will far improve the organic sector contribution to sustainability and environmental challenge through action focus on 
reduce climate and environmental footprint 
enhance genetic biodiversity and increase yield 
develop alternative to contentiou input and other plant protection product 
enhance animal welfare 
make more efficient use of resource 
3 biocide through pyrolytic degradation of biomas 
sustainable agriculture employ efficient management of environmental bioresource which can be use to satisfy anthropogenic need while maintain and conserve natural resource at the same time however sustainable agriculture also focuse at lower the pest incidence without disturb nature balance pyrolysi proces be one of the method choose in order to strive for biopesticide formation pyrolysi be an ecosustainable technique in the energy conversion of biomas to produce biooil biochar and synga slow pyrolysi wa often select a it low down heat rate and long retention time enhance vapor formation from complete secondary reaction form wood vinegar and biochar hardwood or softwood vinegar be an aqueou liquid mixture of organic acid and compound such a acetic acid methanol furfural phenol acetaldehyde furan formic propionic and butyric acid and other volatile organic 

v role of biofertilizer in green sustainable agriculture 
biofertilizer refer to the use of microorganism to meet nutritional need wherea in other country the term microbial bioinoculant be use biofertilizer be biobased organic fertilizer that either could be from plant or animal source or from live or dormant microbial cell that have the potential to improve the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrient uptake in plant 
so biofertilizer be properly define a the preparation contain live microbe that help in enhance soil fertility by fix atmospheric nitrogen solubilizing phosphoru or decompose organic waste or by elevate plant growth through the production of growth hormone with their biological activity biofertilizer be generally apply in solid or dry form which be prepare after pack on suitable carrier such a clay mineral rice bran peat lignite wheat bran humu and wood charcoal carrier increase the shelf life and enable the easy handle of microbial inoculant 
the benefit of biofertilizer include low cost enhance nutrient availability improve soil fertility protect plant from soilborne pathogen sustainable agricultural production enhance biotic and abiotic stres tolerance promote phytohormone production improve soil health cause le environmental pollution and it continue use improve the fertility of soil considerably 
base on the source and raw material global biofertilizer be market under two major category like organic residuebased biofertilizer and microorganism base biofertilizer green manure crop residue treat sewage sludge and farmyard manure be generally organicbased biofertilizer while on the contrary microorganismbased biofertilizer contain beneficial microorganism like bacterium fungi and alga

organic matter be a priority for organic farmer organic matter can be apply through the application of manure compost and animal byproduct such a feather meal or blood meal compost add organic matter provide a wide range of nutrient for plant and add beneficial microbe to the soil give that these nutrient be mostly in an unmineralized form that cannot be take up by plant soil microbe be need to break down organic matter and transform nutrient into a bioavailable mineralize state 

vus role of genetic engineer plant gmpro and con 
genetic modification of crop ha substantially focus on improve trait for desirable outcome it ha result in the development of crop with enhance yield quality and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress with the advent of introduce favorable trait into crop biotechnology ha create a path for the involvement of genetically modify gm crop into sustainable food production system although these plant herald a new era of crop production their widespread adoption face diverse challenge due to concern about the environment human health and moral issue mitigate these concern with scientific investigation be vital with the purpose of gm crop deep characterization and of the appropriate strategy to overcome their widespread adoption 
new and recent tool for genome edit with a special focu on the crisprcas9 platform be elaborate with important impact on the gm crop acceptance for sustainable green agriculture application the advancement in molecular tool through plant genome edit address many of the gm crop issue and facilitate their development without incorporate transgenic modification it will allow for a high acceptance rate of gm crop in sustainable agriculture with rapid approval for commercialization 
the majority of european and middle eastern country have impose full or partial limitation on the commercialization of gm crop nevertheles because the gm crop be consider a good candidate for sustainable food production it be imperative to perform the risk assessment of any develop gm crop explore their negative and positive consequence for the current agricultural development 
beside these technique genome edit tool ha enable the plant transformation with ease accuracy and specificity some of these method include zinc finger nuclease zfn transcription activatorlike effector nuclease talen and cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crisprca system be direct toward the concern relate to the unpredictability and inefficiency of traditional transgenesi 
there ha be a sharp increase in the approval of the number of plant specie with gm variety around 44 country have provide regulatory acceptance to 40 gm crop and to 509 event of genetic modification since january 2022 thi manipulation include 41 commercial trait for use in cultivation food and fee 
the inception of gm crop ha be controversial mainly due to the ethical concern and issue of sustainability surround the negative impact of gm crop

crisprcas9 technique ha the potential to enhance the sustainability and improve global food security in variou way it can introduce 
a abiotic biotic stres tolerance 
b crop yield enhancement 
c quality improvement 
d nutritional enhancement 
e enhance hybrid breed 
gm crop face the moral and ethical dilemma of their incorporation into the sustainable agricultural practice which can be negotiate through the appropriate balance of benefit and negative impact of gm crop by encompass all the three relational aspect of sustainability such a the environment society and the economy 
beside the gm use in sustainable agriculture biotechnology can contribute in many direction to the development of green agriculture a it be present in the follow scheme
