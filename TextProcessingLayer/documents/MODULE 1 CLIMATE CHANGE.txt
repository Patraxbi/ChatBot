module i climate change 

eu target in 2021 the eu propose climate neutrality the goal of zero net emission by 2050 legally bind to the eu whole package of economic policy it set an interim target of 55 emission reduction by 2030 thi goal of zero net emission be enshrine in the climate law the european green deal egd be the roadmap for the eu to become climateneutral by 2050 
1 climate neutrality versu carbon neutrality 
climate neutrality mean to only emit a much greenhouse ga into the atmosphere a can be absorb by nature that be forest ocean and soil to reach such a netzero emission balance by 2050 eu country will have to drastically reduce their greenhouse ga emission and find way of compensate for the remain and unavoidable emission 
carbon neutrality and climate neutrality be often use interchangeably but they be not the same thing so a company can be consider carbon neutral when the amount of co emission emit into the atmosphere be the same amount of co that can be absorb naturally by forest and plant which function a carbon sink thank to photosynthesi or that be compensate by other action in other word 
gros co emission produce co emission absorb andor offset 0 
although it be a simple equation get to zero be a bite more complicate first of all one need to calculate what ymy carbon footprint be it will be explain in a dedicate seminar 
once you know what ymy carbon footprint be one should reduce a much a possible the emission produce a a result of economic activity and on the other hand compensate for those that one ha not be able to eliminate 
to reduce carbon emission the key be to change habit and invest in clean more efficient technology that consume le energy and produce few co but to be honest depend on the economic activity characteristic one will not alway be able to reduce the carbon emission to the point where they be 100 absorb by nature or at least not immediately so those co emission one ha not be able to eliminate it be to compensate for them in other way so that the equation result in zero 

fig 1 application zero waste biochar a a carbonneutral tool for sustainable development 
to compensate for carbon emission not absorb one can choose between different action such a 
carbon capture and storage 
invest in synthetic fuel research 
support project to restore or preserve carbon sink such a invest in forest restoration wetland coastline etc 
or purchase carbon credit 
climate neutrality refer to the mitigation of all greenhouse gase ghg not just carbon dioxide 
in other word a company will achieve climate neutrality when the amount of greenhouse ga ghg emission it emit into the atmosphere be the same a the amount of greenhouse gase ghg that can be naturally absorb by natural sink forest sea etc or that be offset by other action 
in thi case the equation would be a follow 
any gros ghg emission produce any ghg emission absorb andor offset 0 
it be true that carbon neutrality be a big step a carbon dioxide account for about 80 of the planet greenhouse gase but there be still 20 of other gase that need to be in balance in order not to affect global warm we be refer to 
water vapor ho 
nitrou oxide n2o 
methane ch4 
ozone o3 
some halocarbon such a cfc hcfc hfc and pfc 
in many case be carbon neutral will limit the contribution to climate change however any company action should not only focu on mitigate the co emission but also on control and improve emission of these other gase 
in some sector for example they do not need to be carbon neutral to limit their contribution to global warm a they release major amount of ghg see the list above one of the wellknown example be the livestock sector whose contribution to global warm be through methane emission produce by animal 
2 eu politic for climate neutrality 
the european council underline that the transition to climate neutrality bring significant opportunity for 
economic growth 
market and job 
technological development 
for the late option there be a market regulate by the european union it be like a kind of stock exchange where the price per ton of carbon ha be set and where one can buy or sell the need ton of co to meet the legal and carbon neutrality target 
the ec also recognize the need to ensure that the green transition be costeffective a well a socially balance and fair leader call on the european commission to put forward proposal so that country can reach the 2030 goal include by 
improve green finance standard 
strengthen the eu emission trade system 
spur climatefriendly innovation 
ensure fairnes and costeffectivenes 
in july 2021 the european climate law a key element of the european green deal enter into force one month after the council have adopt it eu country be now legally oblige to reach both the 2030 and 2050 climate goal 

fig 2 the climate law set the framework for action to be take by the eu and the member state to progressively reduce emission and ultimately reach climate neutrality in the eu by 2050 
also in june 2021 the council approve conclusion endorse the new eu strategy on adaptation to climate change present by the european commission the strategy outline a longterm vision for the eu to become by 2050 a climateresilient society that be fully adapt to the unavoidable impact of climate change 
another key part of the eu work toward climate neutrality be the fit for 55 package a set of proposal for revision of exist legislation and new initiative it be the eu key plan for turn climate goal in accordance to eu law 



fig 3 fit for 55 package action 
the package include rule on 
energy 
transport 
emission trade and reduction 
land use and forestry 
shift to a green way of life be crucial to addres the climate emergency and reduce dependency on fossil fuel especially those from russium the eu and it 27 country be work on new common rule under the fit for 55 package to reduce the eu carbon footprint 
while emission be rise in some sector such a international aviation and transport other sector have reduce their emission enormously since 1990 with energy industry lead the way with a decrease of 47 by 2020 the eu have already achieve a 30 reduction compare to 1990 level 
finance the eu climate transition 
the shift toward a climatefriendly economy will require major public and private investment 
eu country have commit to spend 30 of the eu longterm budget for 20212027 and the next generation eu recovery instrument on climaterelated project 
to ensure that the climate transition be fair the eu ha introduce a just transition mechanism to provide financial and technical support to the region most affect by the move toward a lowcarbon economy up to 90 billion be to be mobilize to thi end 
30 of all eu expenditure until 2027 will go to climaterelated project 

shape global action 
the eu effort in fight climate change be in line with the commitment make by the eu and the member state in the pari agreement sign in 2015 eu country support a high level of ambition in implement thi international agreement and encourage global partner both in international forum and in bilateral relation to accelerate action to limit global warm 
the eu together with it member state be the big provider of climate finance in the world the fund it provide support climaterelated action in develop country to facilitate their green transition and tackle the adverse effect of climate change 
a 2030 climate energy framework objective 
the 2030 climate and energy framework include euwide target and policy objective for the period from 2021 to 2030 
the 2030 framework maintain the target structure of the eu 2020 package which aim to cut greenhouse ga emission by 20 percent increase the share of renewable energy in the eu final energy consumption to 20 percent and improve energy efficiency by 20 percent along the same line the 2030 framework include an at least 32 percent target for renewable energy and a target to enhance energy efficiency by at least 325 percent 
greenhouse ga emission raise the ambition 
in july 2021 the european commission adopt a set of proposal to make the eu climate energy transport and taxation policy fit for reduce net greenhouse ga emission by at least 55 by 2030 compare to 1990 level 
thi will enable the eu to become the first climateneutral continent by 2050 
the proposal refer to 
1 energy efficiency 
reduce energy consumption and achieve energy save be essential to deliver the european green deal 
2 renewable energy 
energy from renewable source reduce greenhouse ga emission and low my dependence on import fossil fuel 
3 market and consumer

6 infrastructure 
a modern energy infrastructure connect market and region be crucial to meet eu energy and climate goal 
7 energy security 
the eu work to ensure that energy supply from abroad be secure and affordable 
8 research and technology 
innovation in lowcarbon and clean energy technology be essential to fulfil the eu energy union strategy 
9 fund and finance 
eu program call for tender and privatepublic initiative to finance energy project 
10 international cooperation 
eu energy cooperation with country around the world and international institution 
11 nuclear energy 
the eu aim to ensure safe and secure use of civil nuclear energy which generate almost 30 of it electricity 
12 energy system integration 
my energy system need to be sufficiently flexible to facilitate crossborder crosssector innovation and investment 
b 3 main legal instrument in the 2030 framework 
the governance regulation be the major novelty element in the 2030 framework align with the pari agreement it cover three key area plan report and monitor 
plan 
the governance regulation require member state to prepare two plan national energy and climate plan necp and longterm strategy lts the commission must prepare an lt for the eu a a whole 
necp be a core element of the 2030 framework in the necp each member state define it national contribution to the five energy union objective include the eulevel renewable energy and energy efficiency target member state be also require to specify their plan to reach these target along with their national greenhouse ga emission reduction target in sector outside the et necp be prepare every 10 year and update at fiveyear interval 
report 
the governance regulation also serve to comply with report obligation under the pari agreement and to track the implementation of the eu energy efficiency renewable energy and other energy union target 
start from 2023 and every two year thereafter member state must prepare integrate national energy and climate progress report biennial progress report these cover all five dimension of the energy union and describe progress in necp implementation in addition each member state must submit annual greenhouse ga inventory report to the commission and the unfccc unite nation framework convention on climate change secretariat the governance regulation include variou provision on national and unionlevel datum collection and report system a well a registry to account for the ndc nationally determine contribution and international carbon credit 
monitor 
the governance regulation create a monitor system to track the implementation of the 2030 framework and the associate target at the eu and member state level the system rely on ex ante and ex post monitor by the commission 
public participation 
the governance regulation require that member state establish a multilevel climate and energy dialogue involve variou stakeholder and the general public to discus different scenario for climate and energy policy necp may also be consider during the dialogue 
c the climate component of the 2030 framework 
a a whole it ha put precise limit to greenhouse ga emission and create a price for them in the cover sector namely power generation iron and steel chemical oil refinery cement and other build material a well a pulp and paper in addition the et apply to aviation emission in the participate country 
d the energy component of the 2030 framework 
my focu be on the switch to an overall eu renewable energy target national support scheme selfconsumer and renewable energy community renewable in heat and cool a well a in transport include biofuel comprise bioliquid bioga and biomas fuel 
authorize member state to apply renewable energy support scheme and require that direct price support scheme take the form of a market premium 
include provision to promote renewable energy in sector other than electricity namely transport a well a heat and cool 

3 technology for achieve cneutrality 
carbon be one of the most important element that contribute to the existence of life on earth since the industrial revolution cbased resource have be exploit to produce energy food and other commodity affect the global ecosystem in countles way the extensive use of fossil fuel and deforestation to promote anthropogenic activity and urbanization be entwine with global climate change which stem from the greenhouse effect associate with increase atmospheric co2 and other ghg currently the international community be confront with develop costeffective and sustainable method for minimize c emission and promote c sequestration a the global community be move toward c neutrality there be a need to revise my understand of the current state of c flow in the total environment therefore it ha become imperative to switch from nonrenewable to renewable that sustain current production system and addres climate change issue to protect human health and the environment 
to achieve c neutrality and sustainably support human activity it be of utmost importance to reduce fossil fuel and food c emission while promote c sequestration in terrestrial and marine ecosystem 

a technology for renewable energy production 
1 solar energy 
although their power conversion efficiency have reach more than 18 it be necessary to far improve the efficiency and stability of largearea solar cell and reduce the product manufacture and decarbonization cost 
beside photovoltaic and solar thermal technology some strategy to convert solar radiation into stable chemical fuel also provide feasible way for largescale utilization and storage of solar energy toward energy decarbonization for instance great effort have be make on solar hydrogen production demonstrate an extremely attractive route to produce hydrogen fuel by adopt renewable solar energy or solarderived power to electrolyze water 


fig 4 technology for carbon neutrality f wang et al technology perspective for achieve cneutrality the innovation 2 100180 november 28 2021 122 

2 wind energy 
although the wind resource on earth be abundant the uneven distribution of wind resource acros the landscape pose a challenge to the transport of electrical energy produce by wind turbine and the unpredictable nature of wind in term of speed and direction will result in a variable and unstable phase amplitude and frequency for the generation of electricity which may make it difficult to be integrate into the grid 
3 ocean energy 
the ocean energy reserve be enormou globally and be enough to power the entire world technology to harvest tidal and wave energy be on the verge of commercialization technology for harvest ocean current energy thermal energy and osmotic energy be still in their early development stage 
4 bioenergy 
biomas be a renewable source of energy that originate from plant the most important source of biomas be agricultural and forestry residue biogenic material in municipal solid waste animal waste human sewage and industrial waste biomas provide 1314 of the annual global energy consumption variou process be use to convert biomas into energy include the follow a thermochemical conversion of biomas include gasification pyrolysi and combustion b chemical conversion convert vegetable oil and animal fat into fatty acid ester through esterification orand transesterification to produce biodiesel c biochemical conversion convert biomas into liquid fuel eg alcohol and alkane natural ga eg hydrogen and methane different type of bioproduct 
the most common biomas feedstock use for biological conversion be lignocellulosic biomas such a agricultural and forestry residue lignocellulosic biomas be the most abundant and widely available renewable resource in the world mainly compose of three heterogeneou biopolymer 
5 h2 energy 
hydrogen fuel cell technology have develop rapidly and be ready for commercialization to the point that we now see commercial sale of hydrogenpowered passenger car and heavyduty vehicle train and ship the main issue now be to reduce the cost while maintain an acceptable level of durability and efficiency 
6 nuclear energy 
nuclear energy be a major contributor to clean energy account for 40 of lowc electricity generation worldwide and avoid about 17 gt co2 emission a year globally therefore nuclear energy be a strategic approach to ensure national energy security and achieve c neutrality nuclear energy be mainly generate through nuclear fission while nuclear fusion technology be at the rd stage 
7 geothermal energy 
geothermal energy be noncarbonbased heat energy contain in the interior of the earth with the advantage of stability continuity and high capacity it will play an important role in provide a stable and continuou basic load in the future energy structure 
8 energy storage 
the electricity produce from most renewable be random and intermittent which hind the widespread application of renewable therefore develop energy storage technology be pivotal to improve electricity output reliability and stability from renewable 
different energy storage technology have different reliability cost efficiency scale and safety these technology complement each other and their application be dependent on many aspect such a energy storage time site requirement and environmental concern

b technology for enhance carbon sink in global ecosystem 

global ecosystem contribute to the release and capture of co2 methane ch4 and nitrou oxide n2o and influence the atmospheric ghg composition and the climate 

fig 6 system for ghg reduction absorption 

zero waste biochar be a carbonneutral tool very important to reduce solid waste drive by the extensive expansion of food urban and industrial system billion of ton of solid waste be generate globally every year 
biochar a fairly new term but an ancient tool be a porou solid material that be produce from the treatment of feedstock at high temperature 3000c 9000c under limit oxygen or oxygenfree condition the thermochemical decomposition of feedstock into biochar can be carry out by variou method include pyrolysi hydrothermal carbonization torrefaction gasification and traditional carbonization among these method pyrolysi be widely employ to produce biochar since it preserve onethird of the feedstock a persistent biochar product while also generate biooil and noncondensable gase 

c technology for co2 capture utilization and storage 

the co2 capture utilization and storage ccu technology comprise three different process separate co2 from emission source co2 conversion and utilization transportation and storage underground with long term isolation from the atmosphere 


fig 7 the roadmap for co2 capture technology development in the industry f wang et al technology perspective for achieve cneutrality the innovation 2 100180 november 28 2021 122 

co2 utilization 
the co2 chemical utilization refer to process of convert co2 into other highvalue chemical under certain condition of temperature pressure and the presence of a catalyst although significant effort have be make over the past several year the conversion of co2 into fuel and chemical be still challenge in overcome both thermodynamic and kinetic barrier 
because we be already commit to some level of climate change respond to climate change involf a threepronged approach 
1 reduce emission of and stabilize the level of heattrapping greenhouse gase in the atmosphere mitigation 
2 geoengineering be the deliberate largescale intervention in the earth natural system to counteract climate change 
3 adapt to the climate change already in the pipeline adaptation

harness the power of renewable resource in energy food and industrial production system and promote c sequestration in terrestrial and marine ecosystem be see a possible route toward c neutrality and achieve sustainable development goal however the current level of research ha not overcome the major challenge to efficiently use renewable resource in production system and prevent u from depend on fossil fuel many problem still require scientific socio economical political and technological solution to adopt practice that reduce ghg emission in current global production system these include 
1 give that the potential of global renewable energy resource surpass global energy demand the most press research need in sustainable development be enhance the current renewable energy production trend to phase out the use of fossil fuel increase the amount of power and heat generate from cfree source ie sun wind and ocean be one aspect of thi but so be the production of biofuel and hydrogen from biomas the intermittency of wind solar and other renewable energy source be one of the major challenge limit the replacement of fossil fuel with renewable energy energy storage be the apparent answer to the intermittency of some of the renewable energy source however the scalability and costeffectivenes of energy storage be subject to many constraint and limitation energy storage development and promotion entail scientific and technological challenge a well a economic and regulatory concern that must be address in order to drive investment and competition in the energy storage industry improve energy efficiency include residential heatingcooling ha a major impact on reduce ghg emission in my daily life therefore more research be need to fully understand how to maximize energy efficiency and support cneutral economic growth a there be a clear link between energy conservation and climate change mitigation effort to minimize energy consumption in enduse sector will contribute to sustainable development a well a carbon neutrality target 
2 consider that unsustainable management practice in food system span from the production and application of chemical fertilizer to waste landfilling and burn continue to account for a significant portion of ghg emission more research be need to reduce emission from food system and enhance sink of c and other important nutrient ie nitrogen potassium phosphoru and sulfur to achieve thi develop new method for far optimization of waste recycle and naturebased process in agroecosystem along with the technological development of food factory ha the potential to reduce the need for chemical fertilizer and sustainably support human activity give that biochar ha multifunctional value in addition to carbon sequestration there be a need to integrate ecological strategy to optimize biochar production characterization and life cycle analysi and to formulate modelbased standard and experimental evidence to spur biocharassisted sustainable development since terrestrial and marine ecosystem be the large c reservoir on earth strengthen policy that promote afforestation and reforestation and use of cnegative material to conserve terrestrial ecosystem and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystem could contribute to increase c sequestration thereby mitigate climate change 
3 even though the ccu co2 capture utilization and storage approach ha a pivotal role to play in my pursuit of carbon neutrality the adoption of current ccu technology be hamper by their high energy consumption and cost carbon capture and storage in the power industry require scientific and technological innovation to achieve low or even netzero energy use poly generation chemical loop combustion and technology that combine fossil fuel and renewable energy source for capture co2 could open a new era for ccu at the same time the conversion of co2 to fuel and chemical be also a promise possibility but the obstacle of thermodynamic and kinetic need to be overcome 
4 give the utmost relevance of monitor ghg emission from space to ensure the world be on track to meet it climate change mitigation goal the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of monitor ghg emission from satellite need to be far strengthen so a to monitor greenhouse ga emission source and rate more comprehensively and timely the capacity and accuracy of satellite in monitor terrestrial ecosystem biomas also need to be improve remote sense monitor of marine carbon sink potential need new theoretical breakthrough carry out accurate carbon budget calculation base on landseaair joint observation be an important basi for carbon peak and carbon neutralization decisionmaking
