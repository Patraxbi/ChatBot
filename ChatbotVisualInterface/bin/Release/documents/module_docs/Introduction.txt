CONTENT REGARDING THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL (EGD) MAIN SOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Introduction
The project partnership elaborated a comprehensive e-content with 6 modules for the project? target groups of students in order to study the main solution and technologies regarding EGD main domains of interest, from the visionary package of European Green Deal ?policy initiatives. The following modules are developed: Climate Change, Green Energy, Industrial Strategy for Circular Economy, Green Agriculture, Biodiversity, and Zero Pollution.
     
       
The focus is on Green Energy and Circular Economy & Bioeconomy, intended to shape main directions of industrial revolution 4.0 starting and in progress now-a-days.

A dedicated curriculum for e-learning was also drawn up to present this content? learning needs, characteristics & structuring, self-assessment techniques.

The EGD proposed solutions are complemented with 2 focus seminars, (1) Carbon Footprint Calculation and (2) Environmental Kuznets Curve. These applications are useful for the target groups of people from the involved countries, but also from the community interested to understand the quantitative models to evaluate the environment quality. They can learn how to apply, use and interpret main models in connection with environment characteristics? evaluation.

In the next phase the e-forms of the course and seminars are to be prepared, to set them up on the attached to project site? e-learning platform. Based first of all on 4 training sessions findings, but also on many communication-dissemination tools (questionnaires, surveys, free discussions, letters of interest), the whole learning package are to be improved to display final, upgraded e-variants of them in agreement with the target-groups points of view, but also with those of any other member of the interested community.
